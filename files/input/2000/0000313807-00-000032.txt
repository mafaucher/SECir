                               CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

       Unless the context  indicates  otherwise,  the  following  terms have the
meanings shown below:

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES

       'Proved  reserves'  -- Estimated  quantities  of crude oil or natural gas
which geological and engineering  data demonstrate with reasonable  certainty to
be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions, i.e. prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.

       'Proved  developed  reserves'  --  Reserves  that can be  expected  to be
recovered through existing wells with existing  equipment and operating methods.
Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained  through the application of fluid
injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing natural forces
and mechanisms of primary recovery are included as 'proved  developed  reserves'
only after  testing by a pilot  project or after the  operation  of an installed
programme has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will
be achieved.

       'Proved  undeveloped  reserves'  --  Reserves  that  are  expected  to be
recovered  from new wells on undrilled  acreage,  or from existing wells where a
relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled
acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are
reasonably  certain  of  production  when  drilled.  Proved  reserves  for other
undrilled  units are claimed only where it can be  demonstrated  with  certainty
that there is continuity of production from the existing  productive  formation.
Under no circumstances are estimates of proved undeveloped reserves attributable
to  acreage  for  which an  application  of fluid  injection  or other  improved
recovery  technique is  contemplated,  unless such  techniques  have been proved
effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.

ITEM 1 -- DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

                                     GENERAL

       UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, INFORMATION IN THIS ITEM REFLECTS 100% OF THE
ASSETS  AND  OPERATIONS  OF  THE  COMPANY  AND  ITS   SUBSIDIARIES   WHICH  WERE
CONSOLIDATED AT THE DATE OR FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED,  WITHOUT THE EXCLUSION OF
MINORITY  INTERESTS.  ALSO,  UNLESS  OTHERWISE  INDICATED,  FIGURES FOR BUSINESS
TURNOVER INCLUDE SALES BETWEEN BP AMOCO BUSINESSES

       BP  Amoco  was  created  on  December  31,  1998 by the  merger  of Amoco
Corporation  of the USA and The  British  Petroleum  Company  p.l.c.  of the UK.
Following this merger,  Amoco Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of BP
p.l.c. and was renamed BP Amoco  Corporation,  and The British Petroleum Company
p.l.c.  was  renamed BP Amoco  p.l.c.  Amoco  Corporation  was  incorporated  in
Indiana,  USA, in 1889 and The British Petroleum Company p.l.c. was incorporated
in 1909 in England.

     BP Amoco is one of the world's leading oil companies on the basis of market
capitalization  and proved  reserves.  Our worldwide  headquarters is located in
London, UK.

     Our main businesses are Exploration and Production, Refining and Marketing,
and Chemicals.  Exploration and Production's  activities include oil and natural
gas exploration  and field  development  and production  (upstream  activities),
together with pipeline transportation,  natural gas processing and gas and power
marketing  (midstream  activities).  The  activities  of Refining and  Marketing
include  oil supply and trading as well as refining  and  marketing  (downstream
activities).  Chemicals  activities  include  petrochemicals  manufacturing  and
marketing.  In  addition,  we have a solar energy  business  which is one of the
world's largest  manufacturers  of photovoltaic  modules and systems.  The Group
provides high quality  technological  support for all its businesses through its
research and engineering activities.

       We have well established  operations in Europe,  the USA,  Canada,  South
America,  Australasia and parts of Africa.  More than 70% of the Group's capital
is invested in OECD  countries with  approximately  one half of our fixed assets
located  in the USA,  and  about  one  third  located  in the UK and the Rest of
Europe.

       We believe  that BP Amoco has a strong  portfolio  of assets in its three
main businesses:

   -- In Exploration  and Production in the USA we have  established  production
      bases in oil in Alaska and in oil and  natural  gas in the Gulf of Mexico,
      and extensive  natural gas  production in the Lower 48 States.  We are the
      largest  producer of both oil and natural gas from UK fields,  and we have
      exploration  or production  operations  in several  other areas  including
      Latin America, the Caspian Sea region and Africa.

   -- In Refining and Marketing we have a strong  presence in the Midwest,  East
      and Southeast of the USA through our Amoco brand and this is reinforced in
      the  Midwest  and  Southeast  by our BP brand.  In Europe we have a strong
      retail   position  in  fuels  through  a  joint  venture  with  ExxonMobil
      Corporation (ExxonMobil). We have agreed to purchase ExxonMobil's share of
      this joint  venture.  In addition we have  established  or growing  retail
      businesses elsewhere in the world under the BP brand.

   -- In Chemicals we have a strong  manufacturing and marketing base in the USA
      and Europe,  and are aiming to grow in the Asia  Pacific  region  where we
      already have interests in a number of plants. We have a strong position in
      the  technology   and  production  of  olefins  and  derivative   products
      (polyethylene,  acetic  acid  and  acrylonitrile),  as well  as a  leading
      position in aromatics and derivative products (purified terephthalic acid,
      paraxylene and metaxylene).

       The  integration  of BP and Amoco  following  the merger was completed in
1999 and the  anticipated  cost savings at a rate of $2 billion per annum before
tax were achieved by the end of that year.

            Following  completion  of the merger on December 31, 1998 and in the
context  of low oil  prices at the time,  BP Amoco  undertook  a  strategic  and
portfolio  review in early 1999.  This was  completed  in the Spring of 1999 and
resulted,  among  other  things,  in  the  development  of an  asset  divestment
programme.

       The  guiding  principle  of the  strategic  and  portfolio  review was to
concentrate  the combined  Group's  operations on areas of competitive  strength
and, in the upstream portfolio, to dispose of assets which would not be robustly
economic on the basis of conservative assumptions about future oil prices.

     Our new strategy has evolved from those of BP and Amoco. In Exploration and
Production our goal is to have significant  shares of the larger oil and natural
gas  fields  where  our  supply  costs can be fully  competitive  with all other
producers.  We  are  developing  a new  business  division  - Gas  and  Power  -
specifically  designed  to  extend  our  interests  as the mix of  world  energy
consumption shifts in favour of natural gas. In Refining and Marketing we intend
to invest in the  marketing  areas which are growing,  such as China and Poland,
while focusing our refining on advantaged  areas. In Chemicals we are continuing
to  establish  a  set  of  advantaged  sites   distinguished  by  excellence  in
manufacturing  and close  links to both the  supply of  resources  and  evolving
demand growth.

       In July 1999, we announced a new set of targets  taking us through to the
end of 2001.  Our aim is to  improve  returns by around  five to six  percentage
points,  compared  with  the  base-line  of  1998,  on  the  basis  of  cautious
assumptions about the trading  environment.  We cannot,  and do not, rely on oil
prices maintaining their current levels.

     Even allowing for price fluctuation,  we believe we can continue to improve
performance  through selective  upgrading of the portfolio,  including sustained
reductions in costs, a steady  programme of investment in the existing  business
amounting to some $24-26 billion over three years and a programme to divest some
$10 billion of assets by the end of 2001.

       Our  financial  framework  is to maintain a ratio of net debt to net debt
plus equity within a range of around 25-30% and a dividend  policy which aims to
return to shareholders  around 50% of estimated average  replacement cost profit
before  exceptional items through the business cycle. If circumstances give us a
larger surplus it is  anticipated  that cash will either be used to fund further
growth investment or be returned to shareholders.

replacing the volume  produced.  In addition,  157 mmboe were  transferred  from
reserves of  equity-accounted  entities into net proved reserves of the BP Amoco
Group after the  dissolution of Crescendo  Resources  when BP Amoco  purchased a
majority of Repsol YPF's interest.  After allowing for production which amounted
to 1,050 mmboe and sales net of purchases totalling 565 mmboe, BP Amoco's proved
reserves  decreased to 12,363 mmboe. These proved reserves are mainly located in
the USA (48%), the UK (17%) and Trinidad and Tobago (17%).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

THE PROPOSED COMBINATION OF BP AMOCO AND ARCO

     On April 1,  1999 the  Board  of BP  Amoco  announced  that it had  reached
agreement  on  a  proposed  combination  (the  combination)  with  the  Atlantic
Richfield Company (ARCO) of Los Angeles.

     The  agreement  relating  to  the  proposed  combination  (the  Combination
Agreement),  approved by the boards of both BP Amoco and ARCO, provides that all
common  shareholders  of ARCO,  with the  exception of BP Amoco,  ARCO or any of
their  subsidiaries,  will receive 9.84 BP Amoco ordinary shares of US$0.25 each
in the form of BP Amoco ADSs or, at the  election of the  shareholder,  BP Amoco
ordinary  shares,  in return for the cancellation of each of their shares (other
than the shares held by  CH-Twenty  Holdings,  LLC, a  subsidiary  of ARCO) (the
Cancelled ARCO Shares). It also provides for the issue to BP Amoco of new common
shares equal in number to the  Cancelled  ARCO Shares by a newly  enlarged  ARCO
formed by a statutory  merger of Prairie  Holdings,  Inc. (a direct wholly owned
subsidiary  of BP Amoco)  into and with ARCO.  Any right to a  fraction  of a BP
Amoco  ADS or an odd lot of less  than  six BP  Amoco  ordinary  shares  will be
satisfied  by a  cash  payment.  Both  ARCO  and  BP  Amoco  shareholders  voted
overwhelmingly in favour of the combination at shareholders'  meetings on August
30, 1999 and September 1, 1999, respectively.

     BP Amoco and ARCO  announced in early  November  1999 that they had reached
provisional  agreement  with the  Alaskan  State  Governor on a package of asset
disposals and other measures  designed to secure Alaskan  government  acceptance
for the proposed combination of the two companies.  Subject to the completion of
the  combination,  BP Amoco would sell  175,000  barrels of  production  per day
together  with  associated  infrastructure,  620,000  acres of state and federal
exploration  leases,  and matching  stakes in the Trans Alaska  Pipeline  System
(TAPS). The provisional agreement was finalized into an agreement with the State
of Alaska (the Alaskan Charter Agreement) made in early December 1999.

     On February 4, 2000 the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint
in the US District Court (the Court) seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent
closing of the combination.  The Attorney Generals for the States of California,
Oregon and Washington (the Western  States) also filed  complaints with the same
Court.  The  Attorney  General  for the  State of  Alaska  joined  in the  Court
proceedings in support of the combination.

<PAGE>
     On March 15,  2000 BP Amoco  announced  that it and ARCO had agreed to sell
ARCO's  Alaskan  business to Phillips  Petroleum  Co.  (Phillips)  for around $7
billion.  The sale,  which is  subject  to  completion  of the  combination,  is
intended to address anti-trust  concerns of the FTC. The sale to Phillips of all
ARCO's Alaskan business includes a 21.9% interest in the Prudhoe Bay oil rim and
42.6% of the natural gas cap, a 55%  interest in the greater  Kuparuk area and a
78% interest in the Alpine field.  Also included are 1.1 million net exploration
acres,  a 22.3%  interest in the TAPS, and ARCO's crude oil shipping fleet which
includes six tankers in service and three under construction. The reserves being
sold total 1.9 billion  barrels of oil  equivalent.  The Alaskan  government has
accepted that the sale to Phillips of all ARCO's Alaskan business  satisfies the
sale obligations of BP Amoco under the Alaskan Charter Agreement.

     Also on March 15, 2000 it was announced  that the FTC, the Western  States,
the  State  of  Alaska,  ARCO and BP Amoco  had  agreed  to  suspend  the  Court
proceedings, pending discussions for a consent order.

     On March 16, 2000 BP Amoco  announced  that it was at an advanced  stage in
discussions  with the FTC on the  combination  and was  hopeful of  obtaining  a
consent order within a few weeks allowing the Company to close the  combination.
In addition,  BP Amoco announced that, subject to completion of the combination,
it had advised the board of Vastar  Resources  Inc. of the  intention  to make a
tender offer for the minority stockholding of the company at $71 per share. ARCO
already owns some 82 percent of Vastar.

     On  March  23,  2000 BP  Amoco  and  ARCO  jointly  agreed  to  extend  the
termination  date of the  Combination  Agreement from March 31, 2000 to June 30,
2000.

     On March 24, 2000 ExxonMobil Corporation  (ExxonMobil) filed a Complaint in
State Court,  Los Angeles,  seeking a  preliminary  injunction  and other relief
against  BP Amoco,  ARCO and  Phillips  to  prevent  the sale of ARCO's  Alaskan
business to Phillips referred to in this section above.

     Completion of the combination  remains subject to regulatory  approvals and
the satisfaction of other conditions.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED CASH OFFER TO BUY BURMAH CASTROL PLC

     On March 14, 2000 BP Amoco  announced  that it had agreed on the terms of a
recommended  cash offer to buy Burmah Castrol plc (Burmah Castrol) of the UK for
approximately  $4.7 billion (L3 billion).  The recommended  cash offer of L16.75
for each Burmah  Castrol share had been agreed by the boards of both  companies.
The offer is  pre-conditional  and it is intended that the formal offer document
will  be  sent  to  Burmah  Castrol's   shareholders  once  the   pre-conditions
(regulatory clearances) have been satisfied or waived. The offer will be subject
to terms to be set out in the formal Offer  Document  and such further  terms as
required  to comply  with the rules of the London  Stock  Exchange  and the City
Code.

BP AMOCO AND PETROCHINA JOINT VENTURE

     On March 23, 2000 BP Amoco  announced that it planned to form a natural gas
marketing joint venture with PetroChina aimed at supplying the energy markets of
eastern China.  The project is part of a strategic  alliance agreed in principle
between BP Amoco and PetroChina  which also includes a preliminary  agreement to
build a fuels marketing  business in China's coastal provinces with the prospect
of further expansion into other regions.

     These  agreements  are subject to the  execution of  definitive  agreements
between  the  parties,  and  to  all  relevant  government   authorizations  and
approvals.

     BP Amoco also  announced that it intended to acquire  approximately  20% of
the  shares  currently  being  offered,  up to a  maximum  purchase  price of $1
billion, by PetroChina as part of its Initial Public Offering.

     PetroChina  is based in  Beijing,  China and is engaged in a broad range of
petroleum-related  activities;  it is one of the largest  companies  in China in
terms of sales.

                           EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

     The activities of our Exploration and Production  business  include oil and
natural gas  exploration  and field  development  and production -- the upstream
activities  -- as well as the  management  of crude oil and natural gas pipeline
assets and the  processing  and  marketing of natural gas and power -- midstream
activities.  We have Exploration and Production interests in 27 countries,  with
the  main  concentration  in the  USA and in the UK  sector  of the  North  Sea.
Production  during 1999 came from 18 countries.  Our most significant  midstream
activities  are the Trans  Alaska  Pipeline  System (BP Amoco 50%),  the Forties
Pipeline  System  (BP  Amoco  100%) and the  Central  Area  Transmission  System
pipeline  (BP Amoco  29.5%) in the UK sector of the North Sea,  and the Atlantic
LNG plant (BP Amoco 34%) in Trinidad.

      Our Exploration and Production strategy has two key elements. The first is
to maximize the value realized from our existing  assets and resource base. This
includes the following actions:

  -- We actively  manage existing  producing  assets to maintain and improve the
     net income and  operating  cash flow  realized from our oil and natural gas
     production.  In  addition,  we strive to reduce  the cost and  improve  the
     efficiency  of new  investment  projects.  Significant  savings  have  been
     achieved by developing closer relationships with partners,  contractors and
     suppliers,  and by agreeing with these parties common incentives to improve
     productivity.   We  also  link  internal   compensation  to  operating  and
     investment efficiency, as well as safety and environmental performance.

  -- We seek  opportunities  for  profitable  growth  in both the  upstream  and
     midstream  activities,  within the  context of the market  environment  and
     Group financial  policies.  This includes the use of decline management and
     enhanced recovery technologies to increase recoveries and temper the volume
     decline  in  mature  fields.  It  also  includes   investing  in  midstream
     activities  which are  relatively  unaffected  by oil and natural gas price
     movements,  and using our pipeline infrastructure and natural gas marketing
     expertise  to secure  additional  revenue by  transporting  and  processing
     volumes owned by other companies.

  -- We  continually  upgrade  the  quality of our asset  portfolio  by focusing
     investments in core areas and disposing of non-strategic  assets.  This can
     be achieved through asset swaps, purchases and sales. Examples of portfolio
     upgrading  in 1999  include our $1 billion  sale of non-core  Canadian  oil
     properties  in October,  the sale of our  Venezuelan  assets  announced  in
     November  and our $400  million  purchase  of a  majority  of Repsol  YPF's
     interest  in our  US-based  Crescendo  joint  venture.  In March  2000,  we
     announced the divestment of Altura Energy Ltd (Altura),  our US-based joint
     venture  with Shell,  for a total price of  approximately  $3.6 billion (BP
     Amoco 64%). The  transaction is expected to close during the second quarter
     of 2000 and it is  estimated  that profit after tax of  approximately  $260
     million will be recognized by BP Amoco in 2000.

                                       9
<PAGE>
     The second element of our Exploration  and Production  strategy is to renew
the  business  and  to  provide  growth  for  the  future.  We do  this  through
exploration and selected business development activity, as described below:

  -- Our  exploration  programme  focuses on areas  which  have been  relatively
     unexplored  for  political  or  technical  reasons,  and  where we  believe
     substantial  volumes of low cost,  high value reserves  remain to be found.
     Principal areas of activity include Angola, Australia,  Azerbaijan, Brazil,
     Egypt,  Trinidad and Tobago and the USA.  Our Crazy Horse  discovery in the
     Gulf of Mexico,  USA, is one example of this  exploration  growth strategy.
     Finding this field involved  drilling  through 6,000 feet of water and more
     than 2,000 feet of salt to a record depth of 25,770 feet.

  -- Our business development activities focus on obtaining an interest in areas
     new to BP Amoco,  and extending our interests into existing core areas. Our
     In Salah  development is a new venture (BP Amoco 65%) in which BP Amoco and
     the  Algerian  state  company,   Sonatrach,  intend  to  go  ahead  with  a
     $2.5-billion  development of natural gas fields in the Sahara Desert.  This
     development  is  expected  to supply the fast  growing  markets of southern
     Europe with some 320 billion cubic feet (bcf)  annually.  First  deliveries
     are expected to start in 2003.

  -- In a longstanding  core area, the negotiation of new concession  terms with
     the government of Egypt will enable continued investment of $450 million in
     our Gulf of Suez concessions.  The new terms will result in the development
     of 160 million barrels of oil equivalent.  Redevelopment activity conducted
     in our portfolio of giant fields  should be a significant  source of future
     growth.

     Following  the  merger we have been able to  capitalize  on cost  reduction
opportunities  where we had  parallel  operations,  and  have  drawn on the best
practices and  experience of two  successful  companies to optimize  further our
operations  and  investment  programme.  The merger  has also  provided a better
geographic,  oil/natural  gas and  upstream/midstream  balance in our portfolio.
With cost reductions achieved in 1999, we are well on our way toward meeting our
cost reduction target of $2.2 billion by 2001.

     BP Amoco  retains  its 10% equity  interest  (20% voting  interest)  in the
Russian  integrated  oil  company  A O  Sidanco  (Sidanco).  Sidanco  went  into
bankruptcy for most of 1999 and temporarily lost ownership of a major subsidiary
as a result of a forced  bankruptcy  sale. As part of a broad-ranging  agreement
between the parties  involved,  this  subsidiary  will be returned to  Sidanco's
ownership in 2000 and  arrangements  were put in place which made it possible to
take Sidanco out of bankruptcy in January 2000.

UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES

EXPLORATION

     The Group  explores for and produces oil and natural gas under a wide range
of licensing,  joint venture and other  contractual  agreements.  We may do this
alone or, more frequently,  with partners. BP Amoco acts as operator for many of
these ventures.

     The Group's worldwide  capital  expenditure on exploration and appraisal in
1999 was $604 million,  a decrease of $371 million or 38% compared with 1998, as
we focused on high-graded opportunities following the merger of the BP and Amoco
exploration  portfolios.  In  1999,  we  participated  in 84  gross  (24.9  net)
exploration and appraisal wells in 17 countries. The principal areas of activity
were Angola, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Egypt, and the USA.

     In 1999, BP Amoco obtained upstream rights in several new tracts, which are
expected  to provide a  foundation  for  continued  exploration  success.  These
include the following:

  -- In Angola,  we acquired  operatorship and a 26.67% interest in a production
     sharing agreement  covering  deepwater Block 31. This new block is adjacent
     and geologically  similar to other acreage where BP Amoco and partners have
     discovered several large fields.

  -- In Australia we won our three  preferred  blocks (BP Amoco 16.7% to 20% and
     operator) in the Canning deepwater  Gazettal round.  Additionally we farmed
     into the WA-267-P licence (BP Amoco 12.5%).

  -- In Brazil we were  awarded  two  offshore  blocks in the  deepwater  Foz do
     Amazonas  basin  offshore  Northern  Brazil.  BP Amoco is  operator of both
     blocks with a 30% interest in the 15,000 square  kilometre  block  BMFZA-1,
     and 35% in the 25,000 square kilometre block BFZ-2.

                                       10

  -- In Egypt we obtained  operating  rights and 50%  ownership  interest in the
     15,400 square kilometre West Mediterranean deepwater block.

  -- In the USA, in Alaska,  BP Amoco and partners won 25 blocks in the National
     Petroleum  Reserve-Alaska  (NPR-A) at Lease Sale 991. A  subsequent  equity
     cross  assignment with partners  Chevron and Phillips  resulted in BP Amoco
     holding 50% interest and operating rights in a total of 33 NPR-A blocks.

     In addition,  during 1999 we relinquished  exploration interests in several
countries as we continued a process of focusing and shaping our  portfolio.  The
most  significant  of these  was the exit  from  offshore  Nigeria,  but we also
relinquished the Zambezi block,  offshore  Mozambique,  our properties  offshore
southern  Turkey,  acreage in the Latvian  Baltic Sea and our interests  onshore
north Somalia.

     In  1999,  we  announced  significant  discoveries  in  Angola,  Australia,
Azerbaijan and the USA. In most cases,  reserve  bookings from these fields will
depend on the results of ongoing technical and commercial evaluations, including
appraisal drilling. These discoveries included the following:

  -- In Angola, we were involved in eight  discoveries.  Plutonio and Platina in
     Block 18 (BP Amoco 50% and operator),  Orquidea, Cravoa, Camelia and Tulipa
     in Block 17 (BP Amoco  16.7%),  and  Chocalho  and  Xikomba in Block 15 (BP
     Amoco 26.7%).

  -- In Australia, we participated in the significant Geryon and Orthrus natural
     gas discoveries (licence WA-267-P,  BP Amoco 12.5%) which lie approximately
     200 kilometres west of our LNG  facilities.  A further four wells remain to
     be drilled over the next two years.

   -- In Azerbaijan we announced a significant  gas condensate  discovery,  Shah
      Deniz  (BP Amoco  25.5% and  operator).  Gas from  this  discovery  should
      provide the basis to initiate gas exports from Azerbaijan to Turkey.

  -- In the deepwater US Gulf of Mexico,  we announced four  discoveries,  Crazy
     Horse  (BP Amoco 75% and  operator),  Mad Dog (BP Amoco 63% and  operator),
     Holstein  (BP  Amoco  50% and  operator)  and  Atlantis  (BP  Amoco 56% and
     operator).  The  Crazy  Horse  discovery  is  estimated  to be the  largest
     discovery made to date in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

     In  1999,  total  additions  to  the  Group's  proved  reserves  (excluding
purchases  and  sales)  amounted  to 1,172  million  barrels  of oil  equivalent
(mmboe):  829 mmboe through extensions to existing fields and discoveries of new
fields,  and the remaining 343 mmboe through revisions to previous estimates and
the application of improved recovery techniques. The principal reserve additions
were in Egypt, Trinidad and US Gulf of Mexico as follows:

  -- In Egypt we added 90 million  barrels  (mmb) of oil reserves  following the
     successful amendment to the concession terms for our Gulf of Suez producing
     properties.  In addition we added 250 bcf of natural gas reserves  from our
     Nile Delta gas discoveries following completion of gas sales agreements.

  -- In Trinidad and Tobago,  we added through  discoveries and extensions,  2.9
     trillion cubic feet of natural gas,  principally from the Sparrow field (BP
     Amoco 100% and operator).

  -- In the  deepwater  Gulf  of  Mexico  we  added  150  mmboe  as we  approved
     development of a number of fields including Crosby, King and Mica.

RESERVES AND PRODUCTION

       We annually review our total reserves of crude oil,  condensate,  natural
gas liquids and natural gas to take account of production,  field reassessments,
the application of improved  recovery  techniques,  the addition of new reserves
from  discoveries  and  economic  factors.  We also conduct  selective  periodic
reserve reviews for individual fields.

       Details of our net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate,  natural gas
liquids and natural gas at December 31, 1999,  1998, and 1997 and production for
each of the three years then ended are set out in the  Supplementary Oil and Gas
Information in Item 19 -- Financial Statements and Exhibits.

       On an oil  equivalent  basis,  natural  gas  represents  some  47% of the
Group's hydrocarbon reserves (excluding equity-accounted entities).

                                       11
<PAGE>
     Our total  hydrocarbon  production  (including  equity-accounted  entities)
during 1999 averaged  3,107,000  barrels of oil equivalent  per day (boe/d),  an
increase of 57,000 boe/d,  or 1.9% compared with 1998 as production  declines in
mature  fields were more than offset by  production  start-ups  and build-ups to
full production. About 38% of our production was in the USA and 26% in the UK.

     The following  tables show BP Amoco's  production by major field (asterisks
denote  fields  operated by BP Amoco) for the three  years 1997 to 1999,  and BP

UNITED STATES

     We are the largest  producer  of both oil and  natural gas in the USA.  Our
1999 US oil  production  averaged  804,000  barrels  per day  (b/d).  This was a
decline of 3% from 1998.  Approximately 50% of our 1999 oil production came from
Alaska,  32% from onshore Lower 48 states,  and the  remainder  from the Gulf of
Mexico. Our 1999 US natural gas production averaged 2,275 million cubic feet per
day (mmcf/d),  with an additional  94 mmcf/d from the  equity-accounted  entity,
Crescendo  Resources  LP.  This was down 1% from  1998.  Our  current  principal
producing fields in Alaska are in production decline.  Several  developments are
either planned or under construction to temper this decline and enable Alaska to
remain a major producing area for the foreseeable future.  Elsewhere in the USA,
we expect  increases in production in the Gulf of Mexico to more than offset the
decline onshore.

     Development  expenditure in the USA (excluding  pipelines)  during 1999 was
$1,212 million, compared with $1,670 million in 1998.

     In Alaska, our production of crude oil declined from 454,000 b/d in 1998 to
405,000 b/d in 1999.  Natural  gas  production  remained at 10 mmcf/d,  the same
level as in 1998.

      The current status of activity in Alaska is as follows:

  -- Development is ongoing to temper the production decline at Prudhoe Bay, the
     largest producing field in Alaska.  The decline is projected to moderate in
     2000 due to a number of  near-term  projects.  These  include the  Miscible
     Injectant Expansion project which is projected to add 18,000 b/d (gross) of
     incremental  production.  Further,  we are continuing  the infill  drilling
     programme,  a mixture  of new wells,  rig  side-tracks  and  coiled  tubing
     drilled  side-tracks,  which is  expected  to add  22,000  b/d  (gross)  of
     incremental  production.  Additionally,  we are  increasing our spending on
     satellite field developments around Prudhoe Bay.

  -- In line with BP Amoco's commitment to grow the natural gas business, recent
     actions  taken in Alaska  include the  formation of a new business  unit to
     investigate all options to commercialize Alaskan gas. These options include
     export by pipeline,  LNG and Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) technology.  BP Amoco has
     committed to build a GTL test facility in Alaska.

  -- The  Badami  oil field (BP  Amoco 70% and  operator)  came on stream in the
     third  quarter  of  1998.  In  February  1999,  we  temporarily   suspended
     production in order to perform well work and analyze  additional  reservoir
     data.  The field was restarted in early May and has continued in production
     at around 3,000 b/d gross  compared  with an expected rate of around 35,000
     b/d. The Badami partners are reviewing  options for further  development in
     the Badami Unit and the surrounding area. To reflect these factors, we have
     provided $100 million against the carrying value of the property.

  -- The first phase of  development  of the  Northstar  field (BP Amoco 98% and
     operator)  began in 1998 with  module  construction  in  Alaska.  All major
     construction  permits were received in 1999. We are currently  building the
     gravel island where field facilities will be located, installing pipelines,
     and continuing  module  construction for the Summer 2000 and 2001 sealifts.
     We expect production to commence in late 2001 with a plateau rate of 52,000
     b/d net.

     Onshore  in the  Lower 48  states,  BP  Amoco's  production  of crude  oil,
condensate,  NGL and natural gas averaged 569,000 boe/d,  including 17,000 boe/d
from  equity-accounted  entities,  down from 577,000  boe/d in 1998.  Production
comes  from a large  number  of fields  situated  principally  in the  states of
Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming.

     In March  2000,  BP Amoco  and Shell  Exploration  and  Production  Company
(Shell)  announced the sale of their interests in Altura Energy Ltd (Altura),  a
US onshore  oil-producing  joint venture.  Altura is a joint venture  between BP
Amoco   (approximately  64%)  and  Shell   (approximately  36%).  Altura's  1999
production of approximately 150,000 boe b/d gross came from over 6,000 (owned or
operated) producing wells in large secondary/tertiary recovery projects.

                                       16
<PAGE>
     Our production in the Lower 48 states is  predominantly  natural gas. Major
areas of activity include the following:

  -- Overthrust Belt, Moxa Arch and Wamsutter -- southern Wyoming

  -- San Juan Basin coal and conventional gas fields-- Colorado and New Mexico

  -- Hugoton and Panoma fields -- western Kansas

  -- Anadarko Basin - Oklahoma and Texas panhandles

  -- Arkoma Basin -- eastern Oklahoma

  -- Cotton Valley trend -- east Texas

  -- Tuscaloosa trend -- Louisiana.

     Through  divestments  and property  exchanges,  we have focused our onshore
producing activities in areas where we are a leading producer.

  -- Effective  December  31, 1999 BP Amoco and Repsol YPF  dissolved  Crescendo
     Resources  LP,  a  jointly  owned  production,   gathering  and  processing
     partnership, with BP Amoco acquiring a majority of Repsol YPF's interest in
     the assets. The purchase is consistent with BP Amoco's strategy to grow its
     leadership  position  in core  North  American  natural  gas assets and has
     strengthened  our position in the Anadarko  basin by increasing our natural
     gas production by around 90 mmcf/d.

  -- We divested  ownership  interests in three non-core  enhanced  recovery oil
     production assets during the second half of 1999: Beaver Creek (Wyoming) in
     August  and  Bairoil  (Wyoming)  and  Rangely  (Colorado)in  November.  The
     combined 1999 net production for the three properties was 11,500 boe/d.

     In the Gulf of Mexico,  combined  offshore  oil and natural gas  production
increased  from  some  215,000  boe/d  net in 1998 to  237,000  boe/d  in  1999.
Significant  1999  development  activity  in the  Gulf of  Mexico  included  the
following:

  -- In the Mars  field (BP  Amoco  28.5%) we  brought  three new wells  online.
     Production  increased to 167,000 boe/d gross with facility  debottlenecking
     and a peak production of 182,000 boe/d gross was reached in November, 1999.
     Facility expansion work continued to allow the subsea tieback of the Europa
     field in early 2000.

  -- In the Troika field (BP Amoco 33.3% and operator) production from the fifth
     well commenced in March 1999. Total production for all of the wells in 1999
     averaged  132,000  boe/d gross as compared  with 77,000  boe/d gross during
     1998. The peak daily production rate for the year was 155,000 boe/d gross.

  -- Initial development of the Ram Powell field (BP Amoco 31%) was completed in
     1999. Production averaged nearly 97,000 boe/d gross in 1999.

  -- The Ursa oil and natural gas field (BP Amoco 22.7%) commenced production in
     March 1999 from the largest  tension-leg  platform installed in the Gulf of
     Mexico.  Two wells were  completed,  with the Ursa A-7 well  producing at a
     rate in excess of 50,000 boe/d.  Drilling and completion continues toward a
     peak production rate of some 200,000 boe/d gross in 2001.

  -- Development of the Hoover/Diana oil and natural gas fields (BP Amoco 33.3%)
     continued  in 1999.  This  simultaneous  development  of two  fields,  with
     combined resources of 300 mmboe gross,  represents BP Amoco's deepest water
     project to date. All  facilities  are on location and in the  commissioning
     phase. Three wells have been completed with five additional wells scheduled
     for 2000. First production is targeted for mid-2000.

  -- Production from our Marlin development (BP Amoco 86% and operator) has been
     delayed owing to a well design problem which is being investigated.

UNITED KINGDOM

     We are the largest producer of both oil and natural gas in the UK. Our 1999
UK oil  production  of 580,000  b/d was 62,000 b/d higher  than in 1998,  as the
increase in  production  from more  recently  developed  fields more than offset
declines in mature fields. Our UK natural gas production increased 3% from 1,258
mmcf/d in 1998 to 1,301 mmcf/d in 1999.  Increased  production  from the Eastern
Trough  Area  Project  (ETAP)  more than offset the decline at older UK offshore
fields.

     Our 1999 development  expenditure in the UK (excluding  pipelines) was $676
million,  compared  with  $1,432  million  in 1998.  Significant  1999  activity
included the following:

  -- Production  from the first  phase of the  Foinaven  field (BP Amoco 72% and
     operator),  built up to its plateau  level of 85,000 b/d gross.  Located in
     waters 500 metres deep,  Foinaven was the first  producing oil field in the
     deep water Atlantic Margin,  west of the Shetland  Islands.  Oil flows from
     the well through flexible flow lines to a floating  production  storage and
     offshore  loading  vessel  (FPSO) and is then carried by dedicated  shuttle
     tanker to the Flotta oil terminal, Orkney.

  -- Schiehallion  (BP  Amoco  33.4% and  operator)  and Loyal (BP Amoco 50% and
     operator), which together comprise our second west of Shetland development,
     commenced  production in the third quarter of 1998.  Several new production
     records for the fields were set in 1999 and maximum daily production was in
     excess of 170,000 b/d gross.  Average daily  production for 1999 was 95,000
     b/d gross.  Production  in 2000 is expected  to increase to around  130,000
     b/d.

  -- ETAP  production  continued  to  build-up  throughout  1999,  with  plateau
     production  levels of 265,000 boe/d gross  (135,000  boe/d net) achieved in
     the fourth  quarter.  The  development  comprises  seven initial  fields --
     Marnock,  Machar,  Mungo and Monan (BP Amoco operated) and Heron, Egret and
     Skua (Shell  operated).  We have no equity  interest in the  Shell-operated
     fields.  This integrated  development  project includes central  processing
     facilities  over the Marnock field, a normally  unmanned  facility over the
     Mungo field and subsea  facilities  for the other fields linked back to the
     central facilities.

  -- We established  first production in late 1998 from the Phase 2 expansion of
     the Bruce field (BP Amoco 37% and operator). This expansion involves subsea
     development of the western area of the field,  linked by a bundled pipeline
     to a new  steel  platform.  During  1999  development  of the  Bruce  field
     included  completion  of five  platform/subsea  wells and progress  towards
     commissioning  Booster  Compression  on the  Bruce  platform  in 2000.  Net
     production for 1999 was 51,000 boe/d compared with 42,000 boe/d in 1998.

  -- In  November   1999,  we  completed  the  sale  of  our  interests  in  the
     non-operated  Scott  (BP  Amoco  13.496%),  and  Telford  Fields  (BP Amoco
     20.16%),  and block 15/22 (BP Amoco 26%) which lie in the outer Moray Firth
     of the  North  Sea.  Average  production  for the  fields  during  1999 was
     approximately 18,000 boe/d.

  -- In 1999,  the Harding field (BP Amoco 70%)  continued to produce at plateau
     production  rates. The first well into the south east reservoir was brought
     on stream during the second quarter of 1999 and produced  steadily at 7,500
     b/d  gross.  During  the  third  quarter  the  production  facilities  were
     successfully  de-bottlenecked  and in November a record  production rate of
     100,000 b/d gross was achieved.

REST OF EUROPE

       Our oil production in Norway decreased from 103,000 b/d in 1998 to 98,000
b/d in 1999 as a result of natural field decline.  Net production was 38,000 b/d
from  Draugen  (BP Amoco  18.4%),  24,000 b/d from  Valhall  (BP Amoco 28.1% and
operator),  19,000 b/d from Ula (BP Amoco 80% and  operator) and 17,000 b/d from
Gyda (BP Amoco 56% and operator).

       In the Netherlands,  our net production  decreased to 111 mmcf/d from 141
mmcf/d  in  1998.  BP  Amoco  is  supplementing  its  long-standing   production
operations  with the  expansion  of its Peak Gas  Installation,  a  natural  gas
storage facility.  This expansion,  which became operational in 1999,  increases
the capacity of 850 mmcf/d by 50% to 1,270 mmcf/d with the potential for further
capacity increase.

<PAGE>
REST OF WORLD

     The Group's net share of oil  production  from the Rest of World  increased
from 385,000 b/d in 1998 to 407,000 b/d in 1999. This excluded  170,000 b/d from
associated undertakings in 1999, of which 113,000 b/d came from Abu Dhabi, where
we have equity  interests of 9.5% and 14.7% in onshore and offshore  concessions
expiring in 2014 and 2018,  respectively.  Other areas of oil production in 1999
were Australia, Argentina,  Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt,
Indonesia, Russia, Sharjah, Trinidad and Venezuela.

     Our share of natural gas  production  from the Rest of World  increased 14%
from 1998, averaging 2,063 mmcf/d in 1999. In addition,  in 1999 production from
associated  undertakings  amounted to 170 mmcf/d.  The largest  part of the 1999
production  came from Trinidad and Tobago,  with the remainder  from  Argentina,
Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia and Sharjah.

     Development expenditure in the Rest of World (excluding pipelines) amounted
to $956 million in 1999,  compared with $1,569  million in 1998.  In 1999,  this
expenditure was primarily in Canada, Colombia, Trinidad and Venezuela:

- --   In Canada,  we  divested  our heavy and  conventional  oil  properties  for
     approximately   $1.1  billion  in  October   1999.   The  sale   represents
     approximately 60,000 boe/d net of oil equivalent  production.  The divested
     assets included substantial heavy oil operations in the Primrose, Wolf Lake
     and  Wabasca  areas  near  Edmonton,  Alberta.  Also in  Canada we sold our
     significant  2-D and 3-D seismic data base to a seismic  broker,  retaining
     the right to access this data on favourable  terms.  The  divestment of our
     marginal  heavy oil business  will enable us to give  greater  focus on our
     core natural gas business.

- --   In Colombia,  production of the Cusiana/Cupiagua  development (BP Amoco 19%
     and  operator) has reached a plateau of  approximately  69,000 b/d net. The
     Cusiana field is now in decline and the Cupiagua field is expected to reach
     its peak production in 2000.  Colombia has now identified some well-defined
     projects with the aim of sustaining production;  some of these projects are
     extensions in the Cusiana/Cupiagua  area and some others are in the Recetor
     and Piedemonte licences.

- --   We have been engaged in exploration  and production  activities in Trinidad
     and Tobago  since  1961.  We hold a 100%  interest  in 121 tax and  royalty
     licences  and a partial  interest  in a  production  sharing  contract on a
     recently acquired licence. Our Trinidad operations are in a transition from
     primarily oil to a balance of oil and natural gas  activities,  and we hold
     domestic  sales  contracts for up to 700 mmcf/d in Trinidad and Tobago.  We
     are the  sole  supplier  of the  initial  natural  gas  requirement  of the
     liquefied  natural  gas plant  belonging  to the  Atlantic  LNG  Company of
     Trinidad  and  Tobago,  in  which  we hold a 34%  interest  (see  Midstream
     discussion below).

     Drilling  activity  continued  in the  Mahogany  field to  develop  oil and
     natural gas. Our total hydrocarbon  production during 1999 averaged 183,000
     boe/d net,  an  increase  of 66,000  boe/d from  1998.  In 1999,  crude and
     condensate  production  increased  by 4% to 48,900 b/d net, and natural gas
     sales  increased by 85% to 779 mmcf/d net, a result of increased  local gas
     demand and start up of the Atlantic LNG plant  operation.

     The  installation of the Amherstia  platform  commenced in late 1999 and is
     planned  to come on stream in 2000 to feed  additional  domestic  gas sales
     within Trinidad and Tobago.

- --   In  Venezuela,  we  announed  the  disposal  of our  100%  interest  in the
     Pedernales   reactivation  licence  in  November  1999,  subject  to  PDVSA
     approval. BP Amoco retains an interest in other production reactivation and
     exploration blocks. The most prolific of the reactivation blocks is Jusepin
     (BP Amoco 45%),  currently  producing 30,000 b/d gross.  Secondary recovery
     projects are underway in the Jusepin field with the aim of maintaining  and
     expanding production levels. Retained exploration blocks also include Punta
     Pescador (BP Amoco 50%) and Guarapiche (BP Amoco 75%).

     The  Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli  (ACG)  early oil  project in the  Caspian  Sea,
offshore  Azerbaijan (BP Amoco 34.1%) achieved plateau  production in 1999 of in
excess of 100,000 b/d gross.  In April 1999,  the Western  Export Route Pipeline
through  Georgia was  commissioned  and oil is currently being exported from ACG
through two pipelines (the second pipeline being through Russia).  In June 1999,
BP Amoco  was  appointed  operator  of the  Azerbaijan  International  Operating
Company  (AIOC)  responsible  for operation and  development of the ACG complex.
Several additional phases of development are planned.

<PAGE>
     In Egypt,  our  operations  are carried  out by the Gulf of Suez  Petroleum
Company (Gupco),  a joint operating  company with the Egyptian General Petroleum
Company.  Gupco operates seven production  sharing contracts in the Gulf of Suez
and  Western  Desert,  encompassing  more than 40  fields.  During  1999,  Gupco
produced  almost 290,000 b/d (130,000 b/d net),  about 37 percent of Egypt's oil
production,  as well as 78 mmcf/d (35 mmcf/d net) of natural gas. In early 1999,
BP Amoco  finalized an agreement  with the Egyptian  Government  which will help
maintain investment in the country's mature Gulf of Suez oil fields.  Under this
agreement,  BP Amoco will invest $450  million by 2005 to develop new  reserves,
maintain  production,  and prolong  the life of the fields.  Over $50 million of
this spending had been completed by year end 1999, and another $120 million will
be spent in 2000.

     BP Amoco  entered  the Nile  Delta in the early  1990's,  in a  variety  of
partnerships with AGIP,  Egyptian General Petroleum  Corporation and others. The
Ha'py  field was  brought  on stream in early  2000 and the  Baltim  and  Temsah
natural  gas  fields  are  expected  to  start-up  in late  2000 or early  2001.
Collectively,  we have  agreements in place to supply 250 mmcf/d to the domestic
Egyptian market from these and other Nile Delta fields.  We continue to actively
pursue natural gas export opportunities in the Eastern Mediterranean and we have
the public support of the Government of Egypt.

     Through our  equity-accounted  investments in Empresa  Petrolera Chaco S.A.
(Chaco) (BP Amoco 30%) and Pan American  Energy (PAE) (BP Amoco 60%), we are the
second largest energy  producer in the Southern Cone of South America.  In 1999,
these entities  produced 45,000 b/d of oil and 170 mmcf/d of natural gas (net to
BP  Amoco)  in  Argentina  and  Bolivia.  Chaco  and PAE also  have  significant
interests  in natural gas liquids  plants,  oil and gas  pipelines,  electricity
generation plants, and other midstream infrastructure.

     Pan  American  Energy's  regional  midstream  and  downstream  natural  gas
position was enhanced  during the year through the  ratification of the Cruz del
Sur gas pipeline concession (BP Amoco 18%). This pipeline will transport natural
from Buenos Aires to Montevideo  and is the first part of a integrated  pipeline
system which is ultimately  intended to serve the major gas markets in southeast
Brazil.

MIDSTREAM ACTIVITIES

OIL AND NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION

     The  Group  has  direct  or  indirect   interests  in  certain   crude  oil
transportation  systems,  the  principal of which are the Trans Alaska  Pipeline
System in the USA and the Forties Pipelines System in the UK sector of the North
Sea. We also  operate and have an  interest  in the  Central  Area  Transmission
System for natural  gas in the UK sector of the North Sea.  Our onshore US crude
and product  pipelines  and related  transportation  assets are  included  under
Refining and Marketing.

     The Trans Alaska  Pipeline  System  (TAPS)  consists of a 48-inch  diameter
crude oil pipeline running  approximately 1,300 kilometres from Prudhoe Bay to a
tank farm and  marine  terminal  at the  ice-free  port of  Valdez  on  Alaska's
southern  coast.  Alyeska  Pipeline  Service  Company  operates the pipeline and
terminal at Valdez. BP Amoco owns a 50% interest in TAPS, with the balance owned
by six  other  companies.  Each of the  TAPS  participants  uses  its  undivided
interest  in  TAPS  as a  common  carrier,  separately  publishing  tariffs  and
receiving  tenders for shipments  through its share in the capacity of TAPS, and
paying its respective  share of operating  costs. At peak  throughput,  the TAPS
system carried around 2 mmb/d. In 1999, TAPS transported production from Prudhoe
Bay and the other North Slope fields averaging 1.08 mmb/d.

     For a description of the  procedures  relating to the tariffs to be charged
to  users  of  TAPS  and a  general  description  of  pipeline  regulation,  see
Regulation of the Group's Business -- United States.

     There are a number of unresolved protests with regard to the yearly tariffs
which are filed and which set out the charges  for  shipping  oil through  TAPS.
These items are in the process of  resolution at the Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska.

     The use of US-built  and  US-flagged  ships is required  when  transporting
Alaskan  oil to markets  in the USA and  abroad.  In  accordance  with this,  BP
America Inc. has a chartered  fleet of US-flagged  tankers to transport  Alaskan
crude oil to markets.  In 1999, the Alaska Tanker Company (ATC) was formed to be
the single  operator for this fleet.  Over the next few years,  we plan to begin
replacing our US-flagged  fleet as existing ships are retired in accordance with
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  For discussion of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990,
see  Regulation  of the Group's  Business  --  Environmental  Protection.  For a
discussion of the proceedings  arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, see Item
3 -- Legal Proceedings.

     The Forties  Pipeline System in the UK (BP Amoco 100%) is an integrated oil
and natural gas liquids  transportation  and  processing  system  which  handles
production from over 20 fields in the central North Sea. The system was upgraded
in 1993 and has a capacity of more than 1 mmb/d. During 1999, average throughput
was  approximately   943,000  b/d,  compared  with  880,000  b/d  in  1998,  and
transported  its five billionth  barrel.  A Marine Vapour  Recovery  project was
completed  in 1999 and this will lead to a  substantial  reduction  in  Volatile
Organic Compound emissions.

     BP Amoco operates and has a 29.5% interest in the Central Area Transmission
System (CATS),  a  400-kilometre  natural gas pipeline  system in the central UK
sector of the North Sea.  The  pipeline  has a  transportation  capacity  of 1.7
billion  cubic feet per day  (bcf/d).  It  carries  both  proprietary  and other
companies'  gas  volumes  to a natural  gas  terminal  at  Teesside,  North East
England. CATS offers its customers the choice of gas transportation  services or
transportation  and  processing  via two 600 mmcf/d  processing  trains with the
capability  to deliver NGLs for export or for local  industry  with gas entering
the UK National  Transportation  System. In 1999 CATS handled  throughput of 1.2
bcf/d with volumes at the end of the year reaching 1.7 bcf/d.

     BP Amoco,  as AIOC operator,  manages and has 34.1% interest in the Western
Export Route Pipeline between Sangachal,  which is near Baku in Azerbaijan,  and
Supsa on the Black Sea coast of Georgia. AIOC also operates the Azeri leg of the
Northern Export Route Pipeline between Sangachal and Novorossiysk in Russia. The
combined  capacity of the  pipelines is in excess of 200,000  b/d.  Negotiations
with transit countries for the development of an additional export pipeline with
a capacity  of 1 mmb/d from  Sangachal  to Ceyhan on the  Turkish  Mediterranean
coast were progressed.  An Inter-governmental  Agreement between Turkey, Georgia
and Azerbaijan to support this pipeline was signed on November 18,1999.

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

     In Trinidad  and Tobago,  we have a 34%  interest in the Atlantic LNG plant
and are the sole  supplier of natural  gas to the first  train of the plant.  An
export contract of some 440 mmcf/d was established in 1999 for deliveries to the
New England  region of the USA and Spain from the first train of the plant.  Gas
sales  commenced in February  1999 and averaged 246 mmcf/d per day for the year.
Subject to government  and partner  approval,  the facilities are expected to be
expanded  by the  addition  of a second and a third  train at the  plant.  It is
anticipated that BP Amoco will supply the additional  natural gas volumes to the
expanded facilities.

     We have a 10% equity shareholding in the Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company
(ADGAS), which in 1999 supplied 5.2 million tonnes of LNG.

     In  Australia,  our  share of LNG from the North  West  Shelf  natural  gas
development  (BP Amoco 16.7%) remained in line with that of the previous year at
1.3 million tonnes (approximately equivalent to 180 mmcf/d of natural gas).

GAS AND POWER MARKETING AND TRADING

     We are  one of the  largest  producer-marketers  of  natural  gas in  North
America.  Our 1999 gas sales volumes averaged 5.4 bcf/d from the USA and Canada.
This  consisted  of 3.4  bcf/d  from BP Amoco  producing  operations  (including
royalty volumes we marketed under terms of our lease agreements),  plus supplies
we  purchased  from third  parties.  As a result of the  deregulation  of the US
natural  gas  markets  since  the late  1980s,  approximately  75% of our  North
American natural gas production is now sold pursuant to short term gas contracts
which are renegotiated on a monthly,  yearly or other short term basis,  thereby
allowing us flexibility in production  and  distribution.  As the North American
energy markets continue to evolve, we are enhancing our current positions in the
upstream, midstream and downstream natural gas businesses.

     We  acquired  all of the shares we did not own in Canada's  second  largest
natural gas supply aggregator,  ProGas. ProGas is based in Calgary, Alberta, and
purchases gas from around 170 producers in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.
It markets 1.45 bcf/d of gas a day across North America.

     We also reached agreement with Nova Scotia Resources  (Ventures) Limited to
market, on behalf of the Provincial Crown Corporation,  45 mmcf/d of natural gas
production  flowing from the Sable Offshore Energy Project located offshore Nova
Scotia. Under the agreement, we will focus on marketing the gas primarily in New
England and the north-eastern states of the USA.

       BP Amoco's  policy  toward  natural gas price risk in the North  American
markets is  described in Item 9A --  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures
about Market Risk.

     BP Gas, a UK natural gas marketing  company,  started  trading in 1996. Its
principal  business is natural  gas sales to  industrial,  commercial  and power
generation  customers in the UK, as well as gas sales to continental  Europe. In
addition,  we provide  facilities  and combined heat and power  development  and
contract  energy  management  services to  industrial  customers  in the UK. The
significance  of long-term gas supply  contracts  with large  customers  such as
Centrica,  the prices of which are typically indexed against oil or electricity,
has been  declining  as BP Gas takes  advantage  of  increasingly  liquid UK gas
markets to make more  short-term  sales to commercial and industrial  companies.
The breakdown of gas sale arrangements in 1999 was as follows: 33% of production
sold to Centrica, 24% pursuant to other long-term  arrangements,  and 43% in the
commercial and industrial and spot markets. The main source of gas is BP Amoco's
equity  share of gas from UK North Sea fields.  The Company  disposed of its 50%
interest in Beacon Gas Limited,  a retail distributor of natural gas to domestic
customers,  during  1999,  consistent  with its  focus  on  business-to-business
marketing rather than retail distribution of natural gas in the UK.

     Construction  of a 400 megawatt  capacity  gas-fired  power plant (BP Amoco
60%)  at  Great  Yarmouth  in  the UK  continued  during  1999  and is due to be
commissioned in 2001. The Company also received  Government consent to construct
a 500 megawatt  combined cycle gas turbine power plant at the Baglan Energy Park
in South  Wales.  Online  services  to  natural  gas  customers  were  developed
including an online gas trading service for non-fixed price customers.

     In the Rest of  Europe,  we have a 25.5%  interest  in  Ruhrgas,  Germany's
largest gas distribution company. In 1997 BP Amoco signed a 15-year agreement to
supply 15 billion  cubic metres of natural gas valued in excess of $1 billion to
Ruhrgas,  commencing  October 1, 1998.  We supply this gas from our UK North Sea
fields, delivered via the Interconnector, which is described below.

     The Interconnector is a 240-kilometre,  40-inch subsea natural gas pipeline
linking the UK national grid system at Bacton in Norfolk to the continental grid
system at Zeebrugge in Belgium.  Construction work began in late 1996, and first
operation of the pipeline was in October 1998.  We are one of ten  international
energy companies with shareholdings in the Interconnector,  which has a shipping
capacity of 1.9 bcf/d (BP Amoco 10%).

     In Spain,  where the market is being  liberalized  in common  with other EU
states,  we were the first foreign company to secure a licence  permitting us to
market natural gas to industrial consumers.

     During  the  last  quarter  of  1999 we made  encouraging  progress  in the
marketing of future reserves from Australia, Trinidad and the Caspian Sea.

     Plans were  announced in September  1999 to create a Gas and Power business
to market our  substantial  upstream  natural gas reserves and develop a leading
gas and power marketing and trading business.  The Gas and Power business stream
will be reported as a business segment from January 1, 2000. The new stream will
be  responsible  for our  existing  world-wide  gas  marketing  and  development
activities, including gas-fired power generation.

                             REFINING AND MARKETING

       Our Refining and  Marketing  business is  responsible  for the supply and
trading,  refining,  marketing  and  transportation  of crude oil and  petroleum
products to wholesale and retail customers,  and the wholesale  marketing of NGL
in the USA and Canada. BP Amoco markets its products in about 100 countries.  It
has  operations in Europe,  the USA and  Australasia  and in parts of South East
Asia and Africa.

(a)  Excludes BP Amoco's share of joint venture  turnover of $17,117  million in
     1999, $15,080 million in 1998, and $16,692 million in 1997.

(b)  The indicative  industry global  refining  margin is a weighted  average of
     global  margins for the whole  refining  industry and is  calculated  by BP
     Amoco. It reflects the margins generated by a standard  cracking  refinery,
     running similar quality crudes, to similar yields, located in each refining
     market.  The weighting used reflects the presence of BP Amoco's  refineries
     in these  markets  -  principally  those of the USA,  Europe,  Australasia,
     Southern Africa and Singapore.

     Refining  and  Marketing  aims to manage a  portfolio  of assets  which are
believed  to  be  competitively   advantaged  across  the  chain  of  downstream
activities.  Such advantage may derive from several factors, including location,
operating cost and physical asset quality.

     The  merger  of BP and Amoco  created a  top-tier  player in  refining  and
marketing.  We are one of the leading  refiners  and  marketers  of gasoline and
hydrocarbon  products  in the USA,  and a  market-leader  in  premium  gasoline.
Overall we have a strong  geographic  position with the largest market share for
retail sales east of the Rocky Mountains,  including first or second position in
some 20 states.  We also have extensive retail and commercial  businesses in the
UK, the Rest of Europe,  Australasia,  Africa and South East Asia. Worldwide, BP
Amoco continues to be a leading  marketer of fuels,  served by a global refining
network with key refineries among the top performers in their regions.

     The prevailing economic conditions have driven a considerable  re-basing of
business  activities  outside the USA not directly impacted by the merger.  This
activity has necessitated a reduction in employee  numbers;  within the Refining
and Marketing  business some 5,100 people, or 15% of the workforce,  left during
1999.  At the end of 1999 some 45,250  people  were  employed  worldwide  by the
business.

     As part of the Federal Trade Commission's  approval process for the merger,
BP Amoco  undertook to complete  the sale of nine  terminals  formerly  owned by
Amoco in the  Southeast of the USA where there was an overlap  with  existing BP
terminals.  In addition, in order to resolve anti-trust concerns relating to the
sale of gasoline, BP and Amoco agreed to the divestiture of 134 service stations
in six states  where  there  were  ownership  overlaps.  The  divestitures  were
completed during 1999.

     In the UK and the rest of Europe,  during  1999,  BP Amoco's  refining  and
marketing  operations in fuels and  lubricants  were operated as part of a joint
venture (BP/Mobil joint venture) with ExxonMobil Corporation  (ExxonMobil).  Our
international aviation, marine, oil trading and shipping activities are excluded
from the joint venture.  Under the terms of the joint venture, BP Amoco operates
and has a 70%  interest  in the fuels  refining  and  marketing  operation,  and
ExxonMobil operates and has a 51% interest in the lubricants business.

                                       23
<PAGE>
     In December 1999, we agreed with ExxonMobil the principles  under which the
BP/Mobil  European  fuels and  lubricants  joint  venture  would be dissolved in
response  to the  European  Commission's  authorization  of the  Exxon and Mobil
merger.  Under the  agreement - which is subject to a number of  approvals  from
national  governments  and  appropriate  employee  consultation  - BP Amoco will
purchase  Mobil's 30%  interest in the fuels  business  for about $1.5  billion,
subject to adjustments. In addition, the two companies will divide the assets of
the lubricants business broadly in line with their equity stakes (51% Mobil, 49%
BP Amoco).  In February  2000,  the European  Union's Merger Task Force gave its
approval to the dissolution as proposed.

REFINING

     In refining,  our key objective is to operate an advantaged refining system
more profitably than those of our competitors. Advantaged characteristics relate
to supply - the refinery's position in relation to the market; clean fuels - how
the refinery  supports  our clean fuels  strategy;  integration  value - how the
refinery  adds value by virtue of  integration  with other  parts of the Group's
business.  A consequence  of this  objective will be to reduce the ratio between
our own refining supply and the volumes we market to between 60 and 70% from the
level of around 90% existing in 1999. As a first step, the Alliance  refinery in
Louisiana,  USA, has been offered for sale.  There will  continue to be focus on
reducing operating costs and optimizing yields.

     In  addition  to the  Alliance  refinery,  BP Amoco owns and  operates  six
refineries  in the USA:  Texas City,  Texas;  Whiting,  Indiana;  Toledo,  Ohio;
Mandan, North Dakota;  Yorktown,  Virginia; and Salt Lake City, Utah. BP Amoco's
refinery at Lima, Ohio, was sold in mid-1998.

     In Europe, as operator of the fuels business of the BP/Mobil joint venture,
we operate  seven fuels  refineries  on behalf of the joint  venture.  These are
Bayernoil (Germany),  Castellon (Spain),  Coryton (UK), Grangemouth (UK), Lavera
(France), Mersin (Turkey) and Nerefco (the Netherlands).  Additionally, BP Amoco
has an interest in the  Reichstett  refinery in France.  All the  refineries are
wholly-owned  by BP Amoco or Mobil,  except for Bayernoil,  Mersin,  Nerefco and
Reichstett where BP Amoco's and Mobil's  combined  interest is 55%, 69%, 69% and
17%, respectively.

     Mobil's  refinery at Gravenchon  (France),  which is primarily a lubricants
refinery,  and BP  Amoco's  two  lubricants  base oil  refineries  in France and
Germany are operated by Mobil on behalf of the joint venture. BP Amoco's UK base
oil refinery at Llandarcy was closed in 1998 as part of a major restructuring of
the lubricants business.

     In the rest of the world we operate three other  principal  refineries:  at
Brisbane and Kwinana in Australia  and in Singapore.  We also have  interests in
three other refineries:  Mombassa in Kenya, Durban in South Africa and Whangerei
in New Zealand.

     The  following  tables  set out by area the crude oil and other  feedstocks
processed  in the  years  1997  through  1999 by the BP Amoco  Group for its own
account  and for  third  parties,  and for the  Group  by other  refiners  under
processing agreements, and the Group's refinery capacity utilization.

<PAGE>
(b)  The crude  distillation  capacity figures are based on gross rated capacity
     which  assumes no loss of capacity due to  shutdowns.  The figures for 1998
     reflect the disposal of the Lima refinery in mid-1998. The figures for 1997
     reflect the impact of the BP/Mobil  joint  venture for those  countries for
     which  implementation  was completed by the end of 1997. The implementation
     of the joint venture did not have a material  impact on BP Amoco's  overall
     crude distillation capacity in Europe.

(c)  Crude  distillation  capacity  utilization  is  defined  as the  percentage
     utilization  of  capacity  per  calendar  day over the  year  after  making
     allowances for average annual  shutdowns at BP Amoco  refineries (net rated
     capacity).

     In 1999, we operated our  refineries in the USA at an average of 95% of net
rated capacity (1998 and 1997,  95%), our European  refineries at 94% (1998, 95%
and 1997, 98%) and our refineries in the rest of the world at 96% (1998, 89% and
1997, 99%).

     In 1999, we continued our programme of upgrading refinery  capability.  The
Toledo  Repositioning  Project was  completed  in April with start up of the new
units at the  refinery.  This  project,  which  includes a new coker and sulphur
plant,  makes the Toledo  Refinery  a leading  competitor  in the United  States
Midwest with the ability to utilize heavy sour crude for up to two-thirds of its
crude input.

     Also  during  1999 we  commenced  a  project  to allow  low  sulphur  fuels
production  at our Brisbane  refinery.  Completion  is scheduled  for the end of
2000.  Additionally,  over $60  million  was spent on  projects  during  1999 to
deliver cleaner fuels throughout our refining system.

     Emissions of greenhouse  gases  (primarily  carbon dioxide) were reduced by
more  than  3%  compared  with  1998,  primarily  through  operational  actions.
Additional   reductions  are  planned  through   continued   energy   efficiency
improvements and participation in the internal BP Amoco trading programme.

MARKETING

       We market a comprehensive range of refined oil products world-wide. These
products include  gasoline,  gasoil,  marine and aviation fuels,  heating fuels,
LPG, lubricants and bitumen.

       The following table sets out refined product sales by area.

     In  marketing  our aim is to grow our customer  base,  not only in existing
markets but also in new markets - more customers in a bigger geographic  spread.
We are focusing on how we can increase the amount our  customers  spend with us,
whether they be retail customers spending more on items in convenience stores or
business customers spending more on value-added services and solutions.

     Our   objective   is   therefore   to  create  a  more   capital-efficient,
higher-return  business.  In  addition  we  recognize  that  our  customers  are
demanding a wider choice of fuels - fuels which are cleaner and more efficient.

     In Retail,  we envisage  that there will be two distinct  segments:  fuels,
which we intend to grow through franchises,  dealers and jobbers; and a directly
managed  convenience  store segment.  We plan to expand our Retail business in a
disciplined  way through  rigorous site  selection for  convenience or for fuels
sales, and by concentrating  direct  convenience offers in our core metropolitan
markets.

(a)  Shop sales reported are sales through direct managed stations,  franchisees
     and the BP Amoco share of shop alliances and joint ventures.  Sales figures
     exclude VAT and lottery sales but include quick service  restaurant  sales.
     The sales  include  the BP Amoco  share of the  relevant  sales  within the
     BP/Mobil joint venture.

     Our retail network is concentrated in Europe and the USA, with  established
operations  in  Australasia  and  Southern  Africa.  Networks are being grown in
China, Poland, Russia and Venezuela.

     BP Amoco is continuing to improve the  efficiency of its retail  network by
reducing  operating costs and improving  customer service,  through a process of
regularly   reviewing  the  network.   Actions   taken  include   divesting  the
non-strategic  sites or networks,  upgrading existing sites and investing in new
sites.  An essential  element of this strategy is the development of convenience
stores and the provision of related services. Such facilities are often provided
through alliances or other arrangements with partners.  This strategy is applied
to all our retail  networks,  including  those  operated as part of the BP/Mobil
joint  venture.  At December 31, 1999,  there were  approximately  28,300 BP and
Amoco branded service stations  world-wide,  including those associated with the
BP/Mobil joint venture.

     During  1999  we  commenced   implementation  of  two  major  environmental
initiatives.  In January  1999 we announced  our 'Clean  Cities'  initiative  to
market cleaner fuels in 40 of the world's most polluted cities.  During the year
15 launches of the initiative  were  undertaken in major cities around the globe
including Paris,  Atlanta,  Chicago,  and Istanbul.  In April, we announced that
around 200 of our service stations are to incorporate  solar power - the largest
single  project of its kind ever  undertaken.  The first  phase of the  two-year
programme is planned to consist of the installation of up to 400 solar panels on
each  canopy at service  stations  across  eleven  countries  in a  $50-million,
3.5-megawatt  project,  saving around 3,500 tonnes of carbon  dioxide  emissions
every year. As a result of this project, BP Amoco will become one of the world's
largest users of solar power.

     At December 31, 1999 BP Amoco's  retail  network in the USA comprised  some
16,300  service  stations  concentrated  in the  Midwest,  East  and  Southeast.
Developments in the USA during 1999 included:

  -- Divestment of the ProCare servicing and maintenance  business was completed
     in September 1999.

  -- We agreed  the  extension  of our  alliance  with  Bovis  Lend  Lease,  the
     construction  and  project  management  arm of Lend Lease  Corporation,  to
     develop and build new or remodelled service stations.

     In the UK and the Rest of Europe,  BP Amoco's  network  covered about 8,200
service stations at December 31, 1999. Significant developments in Europe during
1999 included the following:

  -- We continued to develop our joint venture agreement with Safeway plc in the
     UK to redevelop some 100 sites  incorporating a Safeway  convenience store.
     By December 31, 1999, 39 such sites had been redeveloped.  A further 36 are
     expected to be  redeveloped  in 2000 with the remainder of the programme to
     be completed in 2001.

  -- In  France,  Portugal  and  Spain  we  continued  to  develop  co-operative
     retailing  arrangements  with our  partners 8 a Huit,  Modelo,  and Speedy,
     respectively.

  -- In Poland and Russia,  we continue to grow our retail  network  towards our
     target of 300 sites,  with the  construction  of a further 37 retail  sites
     during 1999 giving a total of 139 in these countries.

  -- As part of the continued drive to improve the asset base the retail network
     in Hungary was divested in early 1999.

At   December  31,  1999 BP  Amoco's  retail  network  in the rest of the  world
     (primarily  Australia,  New Zealand,  Southern  Africa and South East Asia)
     comprised  some 3,700 service  stations.  BP Amoco now has some 130 branded
     sites in the new  markets  of  Venezuela,  China and  Japan.  In  addition,
     through the Amoxxo joint venture with Femsa,  the Group has a network of 28
     convenience stores in Mexico.

     In our Commercial and Industrial  business we aim to attract more customers
through  innovation in multi-product  offers and cleaner fuels,  packaged with a
range of value-adding  services and solutions;  thus aiming to increase customer
spend and  growth in  volumes  at twice the  market  rate.  Our  Commercial  and
Industrial business operates in Australasia,  Europe,  South Africa and the USA.
This business  includes the supply of fuel,  LPG,  bitumen and,  outside Europe,
lubricants  to industrial  and domestic  users.  In Europe,  the Group has a 49%
interest in the  lubricants  activity  operated by Mobil as part of the BP/Mobil
joint  venture.  In 1999, we continued to reshape our  Commercial and Industrial
portfolio where we believe it to be appropriate:

  -- As part of a strategic  review of our Bitumen  business,  we announced,  in
     December  1999,  the sale of our  Bitumix  road  contracting  business  and
     bitumen supply terminals in New Zealand.

  -- We continued  to develop our LPG  business in Portugal,  and as a result we
     have entered into a joint  venture with Petrogal and Borealis to develop an
     LPG storage cavern facility at Sines.

     Our aviation  business  sells jet and other  aviation fuels to airlines and
general aviation  customers as well as providing  technical services to airlines
and airports.  During the last few years, the aviation business has strengthened
its position in established markets and pursued opportunities in new or emerging
markets.  In 1999, BP Amoco's aviation  business entered two new markets:  Ivory
Coast and Chile. The business now markets in some 87 countries.  It is the third
largest jet fuel supplier globally.

     BP Amoco's marine business sells ship's fuel and lubricants to a variety of
customers including ship owners and operators, covering a wide range of vessels,
from large oil tankers to small fishing  boats.  We operate a network of offices
and supply  points in more than 900 ports across 90  countries,  reflecting  the
international nature of this marketing operation. In June 1999, we completed the
divestment  of our  bunkering  operations  on the US West  Coast.  BP  Amoco  is
continuing  to  develop  the  marine  business,   and  is  pursuing  new  market
opportunities in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.

                                       27
<PAGE>
     In early 2000, BP Amoco's marine  business  announced  that, in conjunction
with other participants in this sector, it had signed an agreement to develop an
industry-backed   internet  portal  that  will  include  an  auction  site  with
facilities to undertake  purchase and sales  transactions  for marine fuels. The
site is planned to become operational in mid-2000.

SUPPLY AND MARKETING OF NGL

     In the USA and Canada, BP Amoco is engaged in the processing, fractionation
and marketing of NGL,  which consists of ethane,  propane,  butanes and pentanes
extracted  from  natural  gas.  The  majority of BP Amoco's NGL is marketed on a
wholesale   basis  under  annual  supply   contracts  which  provide  for  price
redetermination based on prevailing market prices. Sales volumes of NGL for 1999
averaged  307,000  b/d (1998  318,000  b/d and 1997  298,000  b/d).  NGL is also
supplied to BP Amoco's chemical and refining activities.

     BP Amoco operates and/or owns natural gas processing  facilities across all
of North America having a total gross capacity of over 12 bcf/d.  We own or have
an interest in five fractionator  plants in Canada and the United States. Two of
these are located in Canada in Fort Saskatchewan,  Alberta and Sarnia,  Ontario,
and three are located in the United  States in Hobbs,  New Mexico,  Baton Rouge,
Louisiana and Mont Belvieu,  Texas.  During 1999,  additional gas processing and
fractionation capacity came on stream in Pascagoula,  Mississippi to support the
growth in BP Amoco's natural gas production in deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

SUPPLY AND TRADING

     We are one of the world's major traders of crude oil and refined  products,
dealing extensively in physical and futures markets.  Our portfolio of purchases
and sales is spread  among spot,  term,  exchange  and other  arrangements,  and
covers a range of  sources  and  customers  to match the  location  and  quality
requirements of the Group's refineries and the various markets, while seeking to
ensure   flexibility  and   cost-competitiveness.   In  addition,   the  Group's
oil-trading  division  undertakes trading in physical and paper markets in order
to contribute to the Group's income.

TRANSPORTATION

     Our Refining and Marketing  business  owns,  operates or has an interest in
extensive transportation facilities for crude oil, refined products, NGL, carbon
dioxide  and  petrochemical  feedstocks  in the US. It also has  interests  in a
number of crude oil and product pipelines in the UK and the Rest of Europe.

     We transport  crude oil to our  refineries  principally by ship and through
pipelines  linking our refineries  with import  terminals.  We have interests in
eight major crude oil  pipelines  in the UK and the Rest of Europe and a further
thirteen in the USA.

     Bulk products are transported  between  refineries and storage terminals by
ship,  barge,  pipeline and rail.  Onward  delivery to customers is primarily by
road. We have  interests in nine major product  pipelines in the UK and the Rest
of Europe and four in the USA.  We also have  interests  in a major  natural gas
pipeline,  four NGL  pipelines,  two carbon  dioxide  pipelines and many smaller
pipelines. In total, we have interests in some 33,000 kilometres of pipeline, of
which about three-quarters are located in North America.

     The  lateral  pipelines  to the main  Destin  natural  gas trunk  line from
offshore  in the Gulf of Mexico  to  Pascagoula,  Mississippi  and  inland  were
completed in 1999. This allowed connections with a number of other gas pipelines
and access to natural gas markets throughout the Southeast and the East coast of
the USA.  The  Tri-States  NGL  line,  which  runs  west  from our  facility  in
Pascagoula,  Mississippi  to Kenner,  Louisiana,  started up in March  1999.  In
February,  2000 BP Amoco  announced that it exercised its right of first refusal
to purchase  Southern  Natural Gas  Company's  one third  interest in the Destin
Pipeline.  The  purchase  increases  BP Amoco's  interest in the pipeline to two
thirds, with Tejas Destin L.L.C. continuing to hold the remaining interest.

SHIPPING

     BP Amoco  Shipping  owns or  operates an  international  fleet of crude and
product tankers  carrying  cargoes for the Group and for third parties.  It also
offers a wide range of services to Group and third party marine customers.

     At  December  31,  1999 the Group  owned an  international  fleet of twelve
tankers,  totalling  approximately  1.49  million  deadweight  tons (dwt).  This
included three Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), four Medium Crude Carriers and
five Product  Carriers.  All four of the Medium Crude Carriers were in lay-up at
the end of the year.

                                       28
<PAGE>
     Excluding BP Amoco  companies  in the USA, the Group had ten tankers  (five
VLCCs,  four Medium  Crude  Carriers  and one Product  Carrier) and four barges,
totalling  approximately  2.17 million dwt, on long-term charter at December 31,
1999.

     BP Amoco companies in the USA had 20 tankers (two VLCCs and 17 Medium Crude
Carriers and one Product Carrier),  totalling  approximately 2.39 million dwt on
long-term charter along with two other barges on short-term charter. Four of the
Medium Crude Carriers,  totalling 0.65 million dwt, were in lay-up at the end of
1999.

     In  addition,  a large  number of small  coastal  vessels are used by Group
companies around the world.

     BP Amoco Shipping has  contracted to bareboat  charter three more VLCCs for
delivery during 2000.

                                    CHEMICALS

     Our  Chemicals  business  is a major  producer  of  petrochemicals  through
subsidiaries and associated undertakings. BP Amoco has operations principally in
the USA and Europe,  and increasingly in the Asia-Pacific  region.  Chemicals is
also responsible for the supply, marketing and distribution of chemical products
to bulk, wholesale and retail customers.

     Chemicals  margins are driven by the economics of supply and demand and, as
a result,  are  cyclical  in nature.  An  illustration  of this is the  industry
integrated  ethylene/low  density  polyethylene cash margin.  This rose from 523
Deutschmarks  (DM) per tonne in 1996 to 890  DM/tonne in 1997,  then fell to 819
DM/tonne in 1998 and 666  DM/tonne in 1999.  In 2000,  the  chemical  industry's
external  environment  is expected to be similar to that faced in 1999.  While a
pick-up in the growth of  economies  in Europe  and Asia  should  lead to higher
demand,  new capacity  coming on stream will increase  supplies and  competitive
pressure on margins.

     Our strategy is to create competitive  advantage in petrochemicals  through
adding value to Group  hydrocarbons,  industry  cost  leadership,  world-leading
technology, premier market positions, and a bias to higher growth products.

       As  the  petrochemicals  arm  of an  oil  major,  a key  element  of  our
competitive advantage comes through adding value to Group hydrocarbons,  notably
by combining  feedstock,  refining and chemical  processing on large  integrated
sites.  An example of this is our current  investment  programme  in olefins and
derivative products at Grangemouth and Hull in the UK.

     Increasing  competitive pressures in the industry require an enduring focus
on cost  reduction  and we have  made cost  management  an  ongoing  part of our
business. For example, in 1999 we launched our advanced manufacturing technology
project,  which is intended to extensively  automate most of our sites.  Initial
projects are at our Texas City, Texas and Decatur,  Alabama sites in the US, and
at Hull in the UK. We manage costs  structurally too, by focusing our investment
on a limited number of world-class  manufacturing  sites. By limiting the number
of sites, we benefit from increased scale and integration of chemical operations
along value chains.

     Technology will continue to distinguish the most successful  companies from
their  competitors.  Leading  technology  makes us a  preferred  supplier  and a
preferred  joint  venture  partner,  and this in turn should  bring us increased
market  share and access to new  markets.  We intend to maintain  and extend our
leadership in the fundamental technologies that underpin our core businesses. By
way of example,  our strengths in catalysis,  oxidation and fluid bed technology
continue to enhance our leadership  positions across the portfolio from polymers
to basic  petrochemicals.  BP Amoco  has a number  of  leading  technologies  in
operation already and is currently  investing in production  capacity  utilizing
recent  breakthroughs  in  butanediol,  vinyl acetate  monomer and ethyl acetate
manufacture.

     Our leading market  positions make us supplier of choice and give us access
to a wider range of high quality growth  options.  We strive to be number one or
two in the  markets  in which  we  compete,  and we have  global  leadership  in
paraxylene, PTA, acetic acid, acrylonitrile, and other products. Our growth will
be driven by biasing  our  portfolio  towards  products  which are  growing at a
higher rate than the industry  average.  We are present in markets whose volumes
are on average increasing at 6% a year overall.  This is about twice the rate of
global  economic  growth and compares  with an  estimated  average of 4% for the
petrochemicals  industry.  We have also  instituted  a  programme  of  marketing
initiatives  to  improve  our  commercial  capability.  The  programme  embraces
developments  in  the  sphere  of  e-commerce,  including  the  introduction  of
web-based marketing channels.

     We will  continue  to focus  our  portfolio  in areas  where we have  clear
competitive  advantage driven by the strategy elements described above. Over the
course of 1999,  we sold two  speciality  businesses,  Verdugt in  February  and
Plaskon in September;  our share in the Wilton olefins  cracker in June; and our
Fibers and Yarns  business in  November.  We also  announced  the closure of our
joint-venture  Singapore  aromatics  complex.  In 2000, BP Amoco  refinanced the
entity's bank loans and sold its interest in the entity.

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

     BP Amoco has  large-scale  manufacturing  facilities in Europe and the USA.

     BP Amoco's Chemicals business is organized into four broad groupings:

     -- FEEDSTOCKS, including olefins and aromatics;
     -- CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES, including  PTA  and  nitriles;
     -- POLYMERS,   including   polypropylene, polyethylene, and styrenics; and
     -- PERFORMANCE  PRODUCTS,   including  acetyls,  linear  alpha  olefins,
        plastic fabrications, solvents, and fabrics.

FEEDSTOCKS

PRODUCTS

     Our feedstocks group produces and markets the basic petrochemical  building
blocks that are used  primarily  as raw material  for other  chemical  products.
These basic petrochemicals include ethylene,  propylene,  butadiene,  paraxylene
and metaxylene.

     BP Amoco  manufactures  and  markets  feedstock  chemicals  from the  steam
cracking of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.  The olefins - ethylene,  propylene
and butadiene - are produced by crackers at Grangemouth,  UK; Lavera, France (BP
Amoco 50%);  Dormagen,  Germany by Erdoelchemie (BP Amoco 50%); Chocolate Bayou,
Texas;  and Kertih,  Malaysia  (BP Amoco 15%).  These  crackers  produce the raw
materials  for the  production of derivative  products  including  polyethylene,
polypropylene,  acrylonitrile,  styrene,  ethanol and ethylene oxide,  which are
also produced at various BP Amoco plants.

     BP Amoco is the world's largest producer of paraxylene (PX), and one of the
world's  largest  producers  of  metaxylene  (MX),  the  feedstocks  for PTA and
purified  isophthalic  acid  (PIA),  respectively.  We  recover  PX and MX  from
reformed  gasoline  streams at BP Amoco and other  refineries,  and deliver them
into our aromatic acids plants. PX is produced at Texas City, Texas and Decatur,
Alabama in the USA. MX is produced at Texas City.

MAJOR ACTIVITIES

  -- Advanced  Manufacturing  technology  projects  were  started at Texas City,
     Decatur and Hull towards the end of 1999.  These  initial  projects are the
     beginning  of  a  broader  plan  to  implement  the  'next  generation'  of
     manufacturing  across  the  chemicals  business.   This  will  involve  the
     introduction of leading edge process  technology and control  systems,  and
     will create  extensively  automated  facilities  which are integrated  with
     supply from the nearby refineries and demand from the downstream products.

  -- In  the  UK,  work  is  continuing  on  a  major  $825-million  development
     programme.  Included in this programme are investments at Grangemouth.  The
     first stage, a 50-ktepa expansion of ethylene capacity, was commissioned in
     March,  1999.  A second  270-ktepa  expansion is underway  with  completion
     scheduled  for the first  quarter  of 2001.  When the second  expansion  is
     complete, Grangemouth will have 1 million tonnes of ethylene capacity. This
     additional  production  is  intended  to  feed  a  new  polyethylene  plant
     currently being built at the site.

  -- In Belgium,  work proceeded on the  construction  of a 420 ktepa PX unit at
     our Geel site. This unit will employ our technology for PX  crystallization
     and will incorporate new process and catalyst  technologies  commercialized
     at Decatur in 1997. The project is scheduled for start-up in early 2000.

  -- BP Amoco  continued  feasibility  studies on a $2.5-billion  project for an
     integrated   ethylene   cracker   complex  in  China   with  the   Shanghai
     Petrochemical Company. In October 1999, the Chinese government approved our
     proposal for a 50:50 joint venture, and the plant start-up is scheduled for
     early 2005.

  -- In June 1999, BP Amoco sold its 20% share of the Wilton olefins cracker.

  -- In December 1999, we announced the closure of our  joint-venture  Singapore
     aromatics complex. In 2000, BP Amoco refinanced the entity's bank loans and
     sold its interest in the entity.

MAJOR ACTIVITIES

  -- Construction began on a 220-ktepa ethyl acetate plant at Hull and 110 ktepa
     ethanol plant at  Grangemouth,  both  scheduled for completion in 2001. The
     ethyl  acetate  investment  is based on BP Amoco's  innovative  proprietary
     'direct  addition' method for making ethyl acetate from ethylene and acetic
     acid which does not require ethanol as a raw material.

  -- Construction  continues  on a 200-ktepa VAM plant at Hull,  which  uses the
     proprietary BP Amoco LEAP technology based on fluid bed catalyst.  The work
     is scheduled for completion in 2001, and the plant will ultimately  replace
     production from Baglan Bay and Porto Marghera.

  -- We are investing with  Petroliam  Nasional  Berhad  (Petronas) in an acetic
     acid plant at  Kertih,  Malaysia,  with a  capacity  of 400 ktepa (BP Amoco
     70%).  Construction  of the plant,  which  will use our Cativa  technology,
     started in 1998, and production is scheduled to commence during 2000.

  -- In 1999 we commenced construction of a $300-million, 250-ktepa LAO facility
     in Alberta, Canada. It is scheduled to come online in 2001. The facility is
     based on technology used in our Feluy plant.

  -- In February  1999, we sold a small  speciality  business,  Verdugt,  in the
     Netherlands and in October we disposed of Plaspack  Kunststoffe,  a plastic
     net and webbing  business in Austria.  In November,  we sold our Fibers and
     Yarns business, located in the US.

                         OTHER BUSINESSES AND CORPORATE

     Other Businesses and Corporate comprises Finance,  BP Solarex,  the Group's
remaining coal asset, interest income and costs relating to corporate activities
worldwide.

     FINANCE  co-ordinates  the management of the Group's major financial assets
and liabilities.  From locations in the UK, Europe, the USA and the Asia-Pacific
region,  it provides the link between BP Amoco and the  international  financial
markets,  and  makes  available  a range  of  financial  services  to the  Group
including supporting the financing of BP Amoco's projects around the world.

     Moody's and Standard and Poor's have assigned long-term debt ratings of Aa1
and AA+, respectively, to BP Amoco.

     Finance has in place a Debt Issuance  Programme,  under which the Group may
raise an aggregate of $4 billion of debt for  maturities of one month or longer.
At March 24,  2000 the  amount  drawn down  against  this  programme  was $2,705
million.

     In 1999, BP Amoco  purchased the 50% of Solarex it did not already own from
Enron  Corporation  for $45 million.  Our expanded SOLAR business was renamed BP
Solarex.  The new company has a 20% share of the global market and is one of the
largest  manufacturers of photovoltaic cells and modules with plants in the USA,
Spain,  Australia and India. In 1999 BP Solarex  revenues  totalled $179 million
and solar module  production  grew 23%.  Many of BP Solarex's  successes in 1999
were  based on  advanced  technology.  One  major  project,  'Plug in the  Sun',
involved  installing  solar modules on 200 new BP Amoco service stations in nine
countries.  Another  involved  using  solar  energy to power  665  houses in the
Athlete's Village adjacent to the Olympic site in Sydney, Australia.

     COAL  activity  consists of our 50%  interest in PT Kaltim  Prima Coal,  an
Indonesian  company.  This company operates an opencast coal mine at Sangatta in
Kalimantan, Indonesia.

     RESEARCH,  TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING activities are carried out by each of
the major business streams on the basis of a distributed  programme  coordinated
by  the  BP  Amoco  Technology  Council.   This  body  provides  leadership  for
scientific,  technical and  engineering  activities  throughout the Group and in
particular promotes cross-business initiatives and the transfer of best practice
between businesses. In addition, a group of eminent industrialists and academics
form the Technology  Advisory  Council,  which advises senior  management on the
state of  technology  within  the Group and helps  identify  current  trends and
future developments in technology.

     Research  and  development  is carried out using a balance of internal  and
external  resources.  Involving third parties in the various steps of technology
development and application enables a wider range of technology  solutions to be
considered  and   implemented,   improving  the  productivity  of  research  and
development activities.

     The  innovative  application  of technology  and the rapid transfer of this
knowledge  through the Group make a key  contribution  to  improving  BP Amoco's
business  performance,  particularly  in the  areas of the  introduction  of new
products,  safety,  the  environment,  cost reduction and efficiency of business
operations.  We  believe  that,  in  addition  to  improving  existing  business
performance,  the use of innovative  technology can create new possibilities for
the organic growth of our energy- and petrochemical-related businesses.

     INSURANCE.  The Group  generally  restricts  its  purchase of  insurance to
situations  where this is required  for legal or  contractual  reasons.  This is
because external insurance is not considered economic for the Group. Losses will
therefore  be borne as they arise,  rather than being  spread over time  through
insurance premia. The position is reviewed periodically.

                       REGULATION OF THE GROUP'S BUSINESS

UNITED KINGDOM

LICENSING. Pursuant to, among other things, the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934,
all petroleum  existing in its natural  condition in strata in the UK or beneath
its territorial  waters (including its continental shelf) is the property of the
Crown,  and  licences to explore  for and produce it may be granted,  subject to
conditions,  by the  Secretary  of State for Trade and  Industry  (Secretary  of
State). These conditions include provisions relating to the term of the licence,
the  imposition  of  specific  drilling  obligations,  environmental  protection
controls,  controls over the development and  decommissioning of oil and natural
gas fields (including restrictions on production) and the payment of royalties.

DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES.  The  development and production of
UK oil and natural gas  reserves  (including  rates of  production)  require the
approval  or  consent  of the  Secretary  of State.  There have been a number of
policy  statements  by various  UK  Governments  over the years with  respect to
production controls. Although successive Governments have made it clear that the
imposition of production  cut-backs in order to facilitate a coherent  depletion
policy has been kept under review,  the steps taken by the Government  since the
early 1980s have tended to concentrate on encouraging  exploration,  development
and  production  and no  significant  cut-backs  of  previously  agreed rates of
production are known to have been imposed.

OTHER CONTROLS.  In addition to the regulatory powers of the Government referred
to above, the Secretary of State has wide powers over the oil field  operations,
including  gas  flaring,  the  installation,   use  and  tariffs  of  sub-marine
pipelines,  the  construction  or expansion  of refining  capacity and powers to
impose programmes for the eventual  decommissioning  of offshore  installations.
Furthermore,  the  Secretary  of State for  Transport  has powers to control the
positioning of offshore installations if the chosen location is in or close to a
shipping lane. The UK Health and Safety  Executive has wide powers and duties in
relation to offshore  health and  safety.  BP Amoco is also  subject to European
Union legislation,  in particular the Procurement  Directive which regulates the
procedure for awarding major contracts.

PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX.  Petroleum revenue tax (PRT) was abolished in the Finance
Act 1993 in respect of oil and natural gas fields given  development  consent on
or after March 16, 1993 (Non-Taxable  Fields).  Profits from Non-Taxable  Fields
are charged to corporation tax under general principles. PRT is still charged on
profits from fields given development consent before that date (Taxable Fields).
PRT is charged in relation to Taxable Fields on profits from oil (which includes
gas except where  specifically  excluded by statute) won under licences  granted
under either the Petroleum  (Production) Act 1934 or the Petroleum  (Production)
Act (Northern  Ireland) 1964. It is charged on a  field-by-field  basis,  at the
rate of 50% for  chargeable  periods ending after June 30, 1993 (75% for periods
ending on or  before  that  date),  on the  assessable  profit  arising  in each
chargeable  period (normally the six months ending on June 30 and December 31 in
each year), as reduced by any allowable  losses and by an oil allowance  (unless
the  maximum  amount of oil  allowance  has already  been used),  and subject in
certain years to an overall  limit  (safeguard).  PRT is also  chargeable on any
consideration  received  in  connection  with  the use by other  fields  and the
disposal of certain 'qualifying  assets',  the expenditure on which is allowable
for PRT,  subject  to an  allowance  in the case of the use of  assets by fields
which are themselves liable to PRT.

     The assessable profit reflects,  very broadly,  the market value of oil won
less the costs of discovery and production,  including any Government  royalties
payable.  Interest and other  financing  costs are not deductible in determining
the assessable profit; instead, certain costs are designated as qualifying for a
supplement of 35% (uplift).  Uplift ceases for costs  incurred  after the end of
the  chargeable  period in which  the  field's  cumulative  income  exceeds  its
cumulative expenditure (payback).

     Oil allowance  exempts certain amounts from PRT. For each onshore field and
offshore field given  development  consent before April 1982, an allowance of up
to  250,000  tonnes of oil per  chargeable  period is  available,  subject  to a
cumulative  total of 5 million tonnes.  For each onshore field and each offshore
field situated in the Southern Basin of the North Sea given development  consent
after March 1982, the oil allowance for chargeable periods ending after June 30,
1988 is 125,000  tonnes per chargeable  period and the  cumulative  total is 2.5
million tonnes. For each offshore field not situated in the Southern Basin given
development  consent  after  March 1982,  the  allowance  is 500,000  tonnes per
chargeable  period subject to a cumulative  total of 10 million tonnes.  The oil
allowance is shared by the  participants  in each field in  proportion  to their
shares of oil.  Safeguard  provides  that the total PRT  payable in respect of a
field is limited to 80% of the  amount (if any) by which the PRT  profits  for a
chargeable  period   (specially   adjusted  for  this  purpose)  exceed  15%  of
accumulated expenditure (as adjusted). Safeguard remains available after payback
has been reached for half as many periods again as it took to reach payback from
the first chargeable period.

                                       36
<PAGE>
     Allowable  losses  in any  chargeable  period  can be set off  against  the
assessable profits of subsequent or, after making an appropriate claim, previous
periods  from the same field but, in  relation  to losses  arising in respect of
chargeable  periods  ending  after June 30,  1993,  the PRT  repayment  plus any
interest  thereon arising from the set-off of losses against profits of previous
periods  cannot  exceed 60% of the losses set off (85% in respect of  chargeable
periods ending after June 30, 1991 and on or before June 30, 1993). In addition,
relief is  available  against  the  assessable  profit  from a field for certain
expenditure  incurred  outside the field.  There are restrictions to prevent the
obtaining of relief for  expenditure  incurred in  connection  with  Non-Taxable
Fields against profits from Taxable Fields. Exploration or appraisal expenditure
incurred on or after March 16, 1983 and before March 16, 1993,  in respect of an
area for which no  development  decision  has been made,  may be set against the
assessable  profits of any  Taxable  Field  together  with any such  expenditure
incurred prior to that date which is designated as abortive.  There is no relief
for exploration  and appraisal  incurred after March 16, 1993 unless the Company
was already  committed  to it at that date and it is incurred on or before March
16,  1995.  There is an  additional  transitional  relief  for  exploration  and
appraisal  expenditure,  subject to certain conditions,  limited to a maximum of
L10  million  for  expenditure  incurred  on or after  March 16, 1993 and before
January 1, 1995.  Finally,  a loss from a Taxable  Field in which the winning of
oil has  permanently  ceased  which  cannot be relieved  against the  assessable
profits of that field can be claimed  against  the  assessable  profit  from any
other  Taxable  Field.  The  offset of  reliefs  is limited to prevent a company
buying into mature oil fields and setting  pre-acquisition  expenditures against
the assessable profits of that field.

CORPORATION TAX.  Companies are also subject to corporation tax on their profits
or gains from oil extraction activities, although PRT is deductible in computing
any  corporation  tax liability.  There are  restrictions  on using reliefs from
other  activities  against profits or gains from oil extraction  activities,  or
from the  disposal of interests  in oil or of assets used in  connection  with a
field in the UK or a designated  area.  There is also an exemption  from capital
gains taxation and capital  allowance  clawback for certain exchanges of licence
interests  before the development  stage. An election can be made in relation to
expenditure  incurred  after June 30,  1991 for 100%  reliefs  for  certain  net
offshore  decommissioning  expenditure.  Losses created by these decommissioning
reliefs are available for set-off against profits of the previous three years.

       In his Budget of July 1997 the UK  Chancellor  announced  a review of the
North Sea fiscal regime to ensure that an appropriate share of North Sea profits
is being  taxed  while  continuing  to  maintain  a high  level of oil  industry
interest  in the  future  development  of the UK's oil and gas  reserves.  In BP
Amoco's  submission  to the review it argued  that the  existing  fiscal  regime
broadly succeeds in both areas. In September 1998 the Chancellor  announced that
the existing regime would not be changed.

UNITED STATES

TAX. The State of Alaska  imposes  various  taxes on the Group's  operations  in
Alaska.  At  present,  these  include a  severance  tax on oil and  natural  gas
produced,  an ad  valorem  tax on all oil and gas  exploration,  production  and
pipeline  equipment and a corporate  income tax on companies  doing  business in
Alaska.  Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the State of Alaska passed an act
to finance the State's Oil and  Hazardous  Substance  Release  Response  Fund by
imposing a conservation  surcharge of $0.05 per barrel on all oil subject to the
State's oil and gas properties production tax.  Subsequently,  the State amended
the surcharge to suspend $0.02 per barrel of it when the balance in the Response
Fund exceeds $50 million, and as a result the net surcharge is $0.03 per taxable
barrel unless there is a spill that draws the Fund's  balance below $50 million.
Further,  losses  occurring in connection with a catastrophic  oil discharge are
not deductible as business  expenses in  determining  the gross value of oil for
tax purposes in the State of Alaska.

PIPELINE  REGULATIONS.  The  Interstate  Commerce Act requires  common  carriers
engaged in the transport by pipeline of oil in interstate or foreign commerce to
file tariffs with the Federal Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (the FERC) showing
all rates,  classifications,  rules and  practices  between  all points on their
system.  It also prohibits them from collecting any different  compensation  for
transportation from that specified in their approved tariffs.  Third parties, or
the FERC on its own  motion,  may  initiate  an  investigation  of any  proposed
tariff,  which  involves  the  scheduling  of a  hearing.  If the  FERC,  at the
conclusion of a hearing,  finds that a new or increased rate is  unreasonable or
discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act, it may
order the carrier to cease and desist from charging  that rate,  may prescribe a
rate for the future and order refunds to shippers of collected  amounts found to
be unreasonable.

                            ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     The Group is subject to numerous national and local  environmental laws and
regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities. These laws
and  regulations  may require the Group to take future  action to  remediate  or
otherwise redress the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of
chemicals  or  petroleum  substances  by  the  Group  or  other  parties.   Such
contingencies  may exist  for  various  sites  including  refineries,  chemicals
plants,  oil fields,  service  stations,  terminals and waste disposal sites. In
addition, the Group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed
facilities.  Provisions for  environmental  restoration and remediation are made
when  a  clean-up  is  probable  and  the  amount  is  reasonably  determinable.
Generally, their timing coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action
or, if earlier,  on divestment or on closure of inactive  sites.  The provisions
made are considered by management to be sufficient for known requirements.

     The extent and cost of future  environmental  restoration,  remediation and
abatement  programmes are inherently  difficult to estimate.  They depend on the
magnitude of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of the corrective
actions  required and BP Amoco's  share of  liability  relative to that of other
solvent  responsible  parties.  Though  the  costs  of  future  restoration  and
remediation  could  be  significant,  and  may be  material  to the  results  of
operations in the period in which they are  recognized,  it is not expected that
such costs will have a material  impact on the  Group's  financial  position  or
liquidity.

     Management cannot predict future developments,  such as increasingly strict
requirements of environmental  laws and enforcement  policies  thereunder,  that
might affect the Group's  operations or affect the  exploration for new reserves
or the products sold by the Group. A risk of increased  environmental  costs and
liabilities  is inherent in particular  operations and products of the Group and
there  can be no  assurance  that  material  costs and  liabilities  will not be
incurred  in the future.  In general,  the Group does not expect that it will be
affected  differently  from other  companies with  comparable  assets engaged in
similar  businesses.  Management  believes  that the Group's  activities  are in
compliance  in all material  respects  with  applicable  environmental  laws and
regulations.

     For a discussion of the Group's  environmental  expenditures  see Item 9 --
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations -- Environmental Investment.

     In  December  1997,  at the Third  Conference  of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto, Japan, the participants
agreed on a system of differentiated internationally legally binding targets for
the first  commitment  period of  2008-2012.  The  range of  targets  in Annex I
countries  (OECD,  former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries)  against 1990
levels of emissions is from -8% to +10% for a basket of the six main  greenhouse
gases. The USA agreed,  subject to ratification by the Senate, on a reduction of
7%,  and the  European  Union  on a  reduction  of 8%.  EU  member  states  have
undertaken  differentiated  commitments on the basis of `burden sharing' to meet
the overall Community  target.  Projections of the increase in emissions without
any reduction measures are estimated at 32% for the USA and 19% for the European
Union.  If these  targets are to be met a major  reduction  in the use of fossil
fuels would be required,  and this would be likely to have a significant  effect
on BP Amoco's  main  businesses,  but the Group does not expect  that it will be
affected  differently  from other  companies with  comparable  assets engaged in
similar businesses.

     The following is a summary of significant health,  safety and environmental
legislation affecting the Group in 1999.

UNITED STATES

     The Clean Air Act and its regulations require, among other things, enhanced
monitoring  of major  sources  of  specified  pollutants,  stringent  limits  on
chemical plant,  refinery,  marine and  distribution  terminal  emissions,  risk
management   plans  for   storage  of   hazardous   substances,   and  new  fuel
specifications.

     Title V of the Clean Air Act requires major emission  sources to obtain new
air permits.  This  permitting  effort is underway at the Group's US operations.
Title V also requires more comprehensive measurement of specified air pollutants
from  major  emission  sources.  Two  aims of  this  regulation  are to  provide
regulating  bodies with accurate data on emissions  from major  sources,  and to
enable  regulatory  authorities to better  evaluate  compliance  with applicable
emission limitations.  Federal authorities have recently promulgated  monitoring
requirements.

                                       38
<PAGE>
     Risk Management Plan  regulations  require that any  non-exempted  facility
that processes or stores a threshold  amount of a regulated  substance  prepares
and implements a risk management plan to detect, prevent and minimize accidental
releases.  Undertaking an offsite hazard  assessment,  preparing a response plan
and  dialogue  with  the  local  community  are the  primary  components  of the
programme.

     Additionally,  the Clean Air Act imposes  specifications  for motor vehicle
fuels that significantly impact petroleum refining and marketing operations.  In
nine urban areas with the highest  ozone  levels,  reformulated  gasoline  (RFG)
containing  oxygenates  and lower levels of benzene,  and having lower levels of
volatility  was  introduced  beginning  January  1995.  The  emission  reduction
requirements have been phased in over time and are now fully in effect. BP Amoco
manufactures  and markets fuels in some of these nine areas, as well as in other
areas that chose to join the RFG programme.

     Since  1992,   gasoline  sold  during  the  winter  in   approximately   40
metropolitan  areas with high carbon  monoxide levels must have higher levels of
oxygenates such as  methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether  (MTBE) and ethanol. BP Amoco is
providing  such  oxygenated  fuels  in a number  of US  markets.  Recently  some
environmental  groups and legislators have expressed opposition to the continued
use of MTBE as an oxygenate.  Some metropolitan  areas have been able to achieve
compliance with carbon monoxide  standards and terminate their  oxygenated fuels
programmes.

     Beginning  1993,  the Clean Air Act limited  highway  diesel  fuel  sulphur
content  to  0.05%.  BP Amoco  has been  producing  this  fuel in many of its US
markets.  The Amendments also require service  stations located in certain ozone
non-attainment  areas to install  equipment to capture gasoline vapours released
during refuelling.

     The Clean Air Act also requires installation of 'maximum achievable control
technology'  (MACT)  over  a  ten-year  period  at  certain  types  of  industry
facilities that release certain specified toxic chemicals.  Additional  controls
could be required if the US  Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA)  determines
that an unacceptable  residual risk remains after  installation of MACT. The EPA
has  finalized  MACT control  requirements  for certain  categories  of chemical
plants,   refineries,   gasoline  marketing   terminals  and  marine  terminals.
Additional  regulations on some sources in petroleum refineries were proposed in
1998.  These are expected to be finalized  in 2000 with  compliance  required in
2003.  The EPA is also  attempting  to impose  more  stringent  controls  on the
emission of nitrous oxides (NOx) and particulate matter.

     The  Clean  Water Act  regulates  the  discharge  of  wastewater  and other
pollutants  into US waters.  Facilities  are required to obtain permits for most
discharges,  install control  equipment and implement  operational  controls and
preventative  measures.  Requirements under the Clean Water Act have become more
stringent  in  recent  years,  including  coverage  of storm and  surface  water
discharges  at many  facilities.  The  administrators  of agencies for the Clean
Water Act and the  Endangered  Species Act formalized  agreements  linking those
statutes  with the  potential  to limit  access  because of habitat  concerns to
certain areas with development  potential.  During 1995 a final federal rule was
issued  regarding  protection of the Great Lakes watershed which will have local
and national impacts on water protection  requirements.  During 1998, individual
states in the Great Lakes watershed were working on regulations implementing the
federal rule.

     The Oil  Pollution  Act of  1990  (the  Oil  Pollution  Act)  significantly
increased oil spill prevention requirements, spill response planning obligations
and spill  liability for vessels,  offshore  facilities  (such as platforms) and
onshore  terminals.  To provide  compensation  for oil spill  response where the
spiller is unable to do so, the Oil  Pollution  Act  created a $1 billion  fund,
funded by a tax on imported and domestic oil.

     The Oil  Pollution  Act  also  requires  double  hulls  on all new  tankers
operating  in US waters and double  hulls  installed  on  existing  tankers on a
phased schedule between the years 1995 and 2015. Major oil shippers and handling
facilities  are  expected to be most  affected  by the  expanded  technical  and
operational  requirements  for tankers under the Oil Pollution Act.  Regulations
require businesses covered by this Act to carry specified levels of insurance or
other  documentation of financial  responsibility and maintain facility response
plans  that,  among  other  things,  identify  and  prepare for worst case spill
scenarios.  Facilities  must  also  conduct  emergency  response  programmes  in
coordination with area and national response plans.

     The Prince  William  Sound  port-specific  vessel  escort plan  required by
regulations  that  became  effective  late in 1994,  was  updated  during  1995,
including   operational   requirements   such  as   enhanced   tanker   steering
capabilities,  rudder  failure  response  procedures,  and reduced  speed in the
Valdez Narrows, plus directives on communications and training.

                                       39
<PAGE>
     BP Amoco has set performance  objectives to enhance emergency  preparedness
and crisis  management at all  facilities,  and to promote  compliance  with all
related legislation such as the Oil Pollution Act. These objectives are designed
to be  met  through  appropriate  assessment,  planning,  training  and  routine
exercises,  and by the  provision  or  identification  of  sufficient  human and
physical resources.

     The Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act (RCRA)  regulates the storage,
handling, treatment,  transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous
wastes.  It also requires the investigation and remediation of certain locations
where such wastes have been previously handled or disposed of. RCRA requirements
have become increasingly stringent in recent years. BP Amoco facilities generate
a number of wastes  regulated by RCRA and have units that have been used for the
storage, handling or disposal of RCRA wastes.

     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (also known as CERCLA or Superfund), waste generators, site owners, facility
operators  and  certain  other  parties  may be liable  for the  entire  cost of
addressing sites contaminated by spills or waste disposal regardless of fault or
the amount of waste contributed to a site.  Additionally,  most states have laws
similar to CERCLA.

     BP Amoco has been identified as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) under
CERCLA and similar state statutes at approximately  420 sites. A PRP has a joint
and several liability for site remediation costs and so BP Amoco may be required
to assume, among other costs, the share attributed to insolvent, unidentified or
other  parties.  BP Amoco is the PRP  identified as having the most  significant
exposure for remediation costs at 27 of these sites. For the remaining sites the
number of PRPs ranges  generally  from 20 to 200, and BP Amoco expects its share
of  remediation  costs in  respect  of these  sites to be  small.  BP Amoco  has
estimated its potential  exposure at all sites where it has been identified as a
PRP and has accrued  provisions  accordingly.  BP Amoco does not anticipate that
its ultimate  liability at these sites  individually,  or in aggregate,  will be
significant.  The Group is also  subject  to claims  made for  natural  resource
damage under several federal and state laws.

     Other  significant  legislation  includes the Toxic Substances  Control Act
which, among other things,  regulates the development,  testing,  import, export
and introduction of new chemical products into commerce; the Occupational Safety
and Health Act which,  among other things,  imposes workplace safety and health,
training  and process  standards  to reduce the risks of chemical  exposure  and
injury to employees;  and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
which  requires  emergency  planning  and spill  notification  as well as public
disclosure of chemical usage and emissions.  The Occupational  Safety and Health
Administration's  Process Safety Management (PSM) rule formalizes the procedures
used in identifying and minimizing  safety risks at a covered  facility and also
in conducting formal documented hazard reviews of all covered processes.

UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPEAN UNION

     Part 1 of the UK  Environmental  Protection Act 1990 introduced the concept
of Integrated  Pollution  Control  (IPC) of pollution to air,  water and land by
requiring  each  prescribed  process   (including   petroleum  and  gasification
processes) to be authorized.  The controls apply to new processes in England and
Wales from April 1, 1991 and in Scotland from April 1, 1992.  The standard to be
achieved  by  each  process  is the  Best  Available  Techniques  Not  Entailing
Excessive Cost (BATNEEC).  Existing petroleum and gasification  processes had to
apply for an IPC  authorization  by June 30, 1992.  These  processes  were to be
upgraded to the BATNEEC  standard at the earliest  opportunity and generally for
petroleum and  gasification  processes by April 1, 1998. BP Amoco has registered
all sites  affected by the IPC  legislation  and is carrying out  monitoring and
upgrading  of  processes  as required.  Onshore oil  production  facilities  are
covered by separate  guidance  notes issued in November  1995.  BP Amoco has IPC
authorizations for its onshore production facilities which effectively equate to
BATNEEC  compliance.  Where they do not,  the  authorization  includes an agreed
improvement  programme  which BP Amoco is working  towards with its  Environment
Agency IPC Inspector.  The UK  Environmental  Protection Act may also impose new
investigation and remediation  obligations on the Group's UK facilities upon the
adoption of implementing regulations.

     A  European  Commission  directive  for  a  similar  system  of  Integrated
Pollution  Prevention and Control (IPPC) is based upon Best Available Techniques
(BAT) with cost-benefit  analysis as a holistic approach.  In the event that the
use of BAT  will  fail to meet  Environmental  Quality  Standards  (EQS),  plant
emissions must be reduced  further to meeting the EQS. This  encompasses,  among
other  things,  most  activities  and  processes  undertaken by the oil industry
within the European Union. The European Commission has stated that it hopes that
all  processes  to  which  it  applies  will  be  licensed  by July  2005.  When
implemented,  this  directive  will  replace the IPC  regulation  in the UK. All
plants must be upgraded to BAT standards by 2007.

     The European  Union Large  Combustion  Plant  Directive sets emission limit
values  for  sulphur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides  and  particulates  from  large
combustion plants; it also requires phased reductions in emissions from existing
large combustion  plants.  Implementation  by Member States was required by June
1990. In the UK, it has been given effect through the authorization mechanism in
Part 1 of  the  Environmental  Protection  Act  1990.  Large  combustion  plants
required  an IPC  application  to be made by April 30,  1991.  Upgrading  to the
BATNEEC standard is required at the earliest opportunity, at the latest by April
1, 2001. The European  Commission has  considered  proposals to impose  emission
limit  values on small  combustion  plants.  A revised  Large  Combustion  Plant
Directive was proposed by the Commission in 1998 to be considered by the Council
and Parliament during 1999-2000, as part of the EU Acidification Strategy. After
revisions of the EU treaty  agreed to in Amsterdam,  Parliament  has acquired an
increased role in environmental legislation through co-decision procedures.

     As part of its overall  programme  to combat air  pollution,  the  European
Union has set stringent  emission  limits for new cars and  commercial  vehicles
which are being  implemented  in stages.  Beginning  October  1994,  the sulphur
content of diesel fuel was limited to 0.2% and from  October  1996 the limit was
further  reduced  to 0.05%.  Heating  oils were  initially  limited to 0.2% with
further  reductions  subject to review. In August, the Federal German Government
adopted a regulation to encourage early  introduction  of low sulphur  transport
fuels by setting  differential excise taxes for gasoline and diesel with maximum
50 ppm sulphur  content  from  November  2001,  and for a maximum of 10 ppm from
January 2001. It also proposed that 10 ppm sulphur fuels should be adopted at EU
level.  Implementation of the German regulation depends on tax derogations being
agreed by the  Commission and the other Member  States.  The Commission  made it
clear that it will not consider 10 ppm sulphur fuels within the current Auto/Oil
Programme for implementation in 2005.

     In 1998,  the EU adopted  directives  to set  emission  limits for cars and
light vehicles to apply from 2000, together with specifications for gasoline and
diesel fuel to apply from that date.  Some member States indicate that they need
such energy product taxes to enable them to meet their Kyoto commitments, within
the  EU  burden  sharing  agreement,   and  are  already  implementing  national
legislation.  The Commission is also undertaking a second Auto/Oil  Programme to
propose changes to other gasoline and diesel fuel  specifications  from 2005, as
well as non-technical measures designed to help meet air quality targets.

     In April  1999,  the EU adopted a directive  to further  reduce the sulphur
content of liquid fuels,  but  excluding  marine bunker fuel oil, and marine gas
oil used by ships  crossing a frontier  between a third country and an EU Member
State.  Sulphur in gas oil will be limited to 0.2% from July 2000, and 0.1% from
January 2008.  From January  2003,  sulphur in heavy fuel oil will be limited to
1%,  except  where  use of  heavy  fuel  oil up to 3%  sulphur  can be  used  in
combustion plants without exceeding  specific emission limits, and provided that
local air quality standards are met.

     As part of its  overall  approach to  improving  air  quality,  in 1997 the
Commission  proposed its  Acidification  Strategy,  and  followed  this with its
proposal for a strategy to combat  tropospheric  ozone.  The Ozone  Strategy was
adopted in 1998.  Four air  quality  targets  have been  adopted  as  Commission
Directives, two more have been proposed and a target of 120 micrograms per cubic
metre for ozone  itself was  proposed  in 1999,  together  with a  proposal  for
national  emission ceilings for the main polluting  emissions.  Upon adoption by
the Council,  these targets and ceilings will be the reference point for further
environmental controls of industrial installations at Community and Member State
levels.

     As part of its ozone strategy,  the EU has taken action on volatile organic
compounds (VOCs). In late 1994, the European Union adopted the so-called Stage 1
VOC controls  which  require a 90% cut in  emissions  over ten years from petrol
transport and storage.  In November 1996, the Commission proposed a directive on
control of emissions of organic solvents from the  solvent-using  industry which
has the goal of combating  low-level ozone by setting emission limits and, as an
alternative,  targets to be met by national plans. Existing  installations would
be required to reach  compliance  by 2007 (VOC).  This proposal was adopted as a
directive during 1998.

     As part of a package to stabilize  carbon dioxide  emissions at 1990 levels
by  the  year  2000,  the  European   Commission   proposed  a  combined  carbon
dioxide/energy tax. In March 1997, the Commission proposed instead an energy tax
that is intended to be fiscally  neutral when applied by Member  States.  Though
formally the proposal replaces the carbon  dioxide/energy  tax proposal that had
been  blocked in Council,  it has as its main  objective to provide a harmonized
framework  by  setting  minimum  levels  for  national  excise  taxes on  energy
products, and to allow Member States greater flexibility to offer tax incentives
based on environmental  criteria,  whilst avoiding  barriers to trade within the
Single  Market.  Maximum  sulphur  levels for gasoline and diesel fuels to apply
from 2005 were also agreed as 50 ppm, which is 0.005%,  and 35% maximum aromatic
content for gasoline from the same date. In 1999,  this was followed by emission
limits  for heavy  commercial  vehicles,  also based on the  Auto/Oil  Programme
conclusions.

     The European Union enacted the Major Hazards (Seveso) Directive (the Seveso
Directive) in 1982. The intention of this legislation is to identify  industrial
sites which have the potential to suffer a major  accident which would impact on
the neighbouring population. Such sites are defined by the hazards that exist on
them,  in some cases by the process in  operation,  but mainly by exceeding  the
defined threshold quantities of various categories of 'dangerous  substances' in
storage or use on the premises. It is the responsibility of the site to evaluate
their  hazards.  Those which fall into the  category of a major hazard site must
produce  a  safety  case  which  contains  the  evaluation  of the  hazards,  an
assessment of the consequences of the most serious credible  incidents which can
occur,  both on and off site, and a description of the emergency plan which they
have in place to deal  with  them.  The  safety  case must be  submitted  to the
national regulator,  who acts on behalf of the local authority. The site is also
expected to communicate the relevant  aspects of its emergency plan to the local
community.  All BP Amoco  sites in  Europe  are in  compliance  with the  Seveso
Directive  as enacted  in each  specific  country.  The  European  Union has now
adopted  a revised  Seveso  Directive  known as the  Control  of Major  Accident
Hazards  Regulation,  which came into force in February 1999. The main objective
of this revision is to ensure that effective  safety  management  systems are in
place.

     The  European  Commission  is  committed  to issue  in early  2000 a `white
(consultation)  paper' on the scope for  proposing a  harmonized  EU approach to
liability for environmental damage. This follows a `green (discussion) paper' in
1992 that focused on a strict liability approach.

     The UK Offshore Safety Act 1992 came into force on March 6, 1992.  Detailed
implementation  is through  regulations  made under  existing  health and safety
legislation  enforced  by the UK  Health  and  Safety  Executive.  The  Offshore
Installations  (Safety  Case)  Regulations  1992 came into force in May 1993. BP
Amoco  submitted  all safety cases by the required date of November  1993.  This
included 22 operational  safety cases, all of which have been accepted,  and two
design safety cases on new  installations.  As part of the safety case, BP Amoco
was  required  to justify  continued  operation  and outline  remedial  measures
identified  as part of the risk  assessment  completed.  Work on these  remedial
works was completed by the November 1995 deadline.

MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

     The Group's world-wide HSE policy is developed within a framework set by BP
Amoco p.l.c.'s board of directors.  The policy is implemented through targets in
the corporate and business  performance  contracts and  programmes  ranging from
pollution  prevention  through safety management and product  stewardship.  Each
part of the BP Amoco Group reviews its own performance  and an assurance  report
is presented  annually to the Group Chief Executive.  The Ethics and Environment
Assurance  Committee of the board of  directors,  comprising  six  non-executive
directors,  reviews  policies and processes  which bear upon the Group's health,
safety and environmental relationships.

                  ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH MAY AFFECT BUSINESS

     In order to utilize  the `Safe  Harbor'  provisions  of the  United  States
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995,  BP Amoco is providing  the
following cautionary statement.  This document contains certain  forward-looking
statements  with respect to the financial  condition,  results of operations and
business  of BP Amoco and certain of the plans and  objectives  of BP Amoco with
respect to these items.  These  statements  may  generally,  but not always,  be
identified  by the use of  words  such  as  `anticipates'  `should',  `expects',
`estimates',  `believes'  or similar  expressions.  In  particular,  among other
statements,  (i) certain statements in Item 1 - Description of Business and Item
9 - Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations  with regard to management aims and  objectives,  planned  expansion,
investment or other projects,  expected or targeted production volume,  capacity
or rate, the date or period in which production is scheduled or expected to come
on stream or a project or action is scheduled or expected to be  completed,  and
statements  regarding  the  benefits  of the  merger  with  ARCO;  and  (ii) the
statements  in  Item 9 -  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  including the  statements  under  `Outlook'
with regard to trends in results of operations,  margins  overall market trends,
costs,   dividends,   returns,   risk   management  and  exchange   rates,   are
forward-looking in nature. By their nature,  forward-looking  statements involve
risk and uncertainty  because they relate to events and depend on  circumstances
that will occur in the future and are outside  the  control of BP Amoco.  Actual
results may differ materially from those expressed in such statements, depending
on a variety of  factors,  including  the  specific  factors  identified  in the
discussions  accompanying  such  forward-looking  statements;  future  levels of
industry product supply,  demand and pricing;  political  stability and economic
growth in relevant areas of the world; development and use of new technology and
successful partnering;  the actions of competitors,  natural disasters and other
changes to business  conditions;  and other factors discussed  elsewhere in this
report. In addition to factors set forth elsewhere in this report, the following
are important  factors,  although not exhaustive,  that may cause actual results
and  developments to differ  materially from those expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements.

                                       42

     There is strong  competition,  both within the oil  industry and with other
industries, in supplying the fuel needs of commerce,  industry and the home. The
oil industry is also  particularly  subject to regulation  and  intervention  by
governments throughout the world in such matters as the award of exploration and
production   interests,   the  imposition  of  specific  drilling   obligations,
environmental   protection   controls,   control   over  the   development   and
decommissioning of a field (including restrictions on production) and, possibly,
nationalization,  expropriation  or  cancellation  of contract  rights.  The oil
industry is also subject to the payment of royalties and taxation, which tend to
be high compared with those payable in respect of other commercial activities.

     Exploration  and  production  require  high levels of  investment  and have
particular economic risks and opportunities. They are subject to natural hazards
and other uncertainties including those relating to the physical characteristics
of an oil or natural gas field.

     Oil  prices are  subject to  international  supply  and  demand.  Political
developments (especially in the Middle East) and the outcome of meetings of OPEC
can particularly  affect world oil supply and oil prices.  The refining industry
is  suffering  from severe  oversupply.  Crude oil prices are  generally  set in
dollars  while  sales of refined  products  may be in a variety  of  currencies.
Fluctuation  in  exchange  rates can  therefore  give rise to  foreign  exchange
exposures.

     Sectors of the  chemicals  industry  are also  subject to  fluctuations  in
supply and demand within the chemicals market,  with consequent effect on prices
and  profitability,  and to  governmental  regulation and  intervention  in such
matters as safety and environmental controls.

ITEM 2 -- DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

     BP Amoco has  freehold and  leasehold  interests in real estate in numerous
countries throughout the world, but no one individual property is significant to
the Group as a whole. See Item 1 -- Description of Business for a description of
the Group's reserves and sources of crude oil and natural gas.

                                       43
<PAGE>
ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Save as disclosed in the following  paragraph,  no member of the Group is a
party to, and no  property  of a member of the Group is subject  to, any pending
legal proceedings which are significant to the Group.

     Approximately 200 lawsuits were filed in State and Federal Courts in Alaska
seeking  compensatory  and punitive  damages arising out of the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Prince  William  Sound in March  1989.  Most of those suits named Exxon
(now ExxonMobil), Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (Alyeska), which operates the
oil terminal at Valdez,  and the other oil companies which own Alyeska.  Alyeska
initially  responded to the spill until the response was taken over by Exxon. BP
Amoco owns a 50%  interest in Alyeska  through a  subsidiary  of BP America Inc.
Alyeska and its owners have  settled all of the claims  against them under these
lawsuits.  Exxon has indicated that it may file a claim for contribution against
Alyeska for a portion of the costs and  damages  which it has  incurred.  If any
claims are asserted by Exxon which affect Alyeska and its owners, BP Amoco would
defend the claims vigorously.

     The Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) has  challenged  the  application  of
certain foreign income taxes as credits against BP Amoco  Corporation's US taxes
that  otherwise  would have been payable for the years 1980 to 1992. On June 18,
1992, the IRS issued a statutory  Notice of Deficiency  for additional  taxes in
the amount of $466 million,  plus  interest,  relating to 1980 to 1982. BP Amoco
filed a petition  in the US Tax Court  contesting  the IRS  statutory  Notice of
Deficiency.  Trial on the matter  was held in April  1995,  and a  decision  was
rendered  by the US Tax  Court in March  1996,  in BP  Amoco's  favour.  The IRS
appealed  the Tax  Court's  decision  to the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit and on March 11,  1998,  the Seventh  Circuit  affirmed  the Tax Court's
prior decision. A comparable adjustment of foreign tax credits for each year has
been proposed for the years 1983 to 1992 based upon  subsequent  IRS audits.  In
November  1999,  BP Amoco  Corporation  reached an  agreement  with the IRS that
effectively  resolves  this  issue  at a  minimal  tax cost to the  Company.  On
December 13,1999 the parties filed a status report with the US Tax Court for the
years 1983-1989  advising the Court that a basis for settlement had been reached
and that final  calculations  were in the process of being prepared.  Once these
calculations  are  finalized,  the  parties  expect to file an  agreed  decision
document  for  the  Court's  final  approval,   which  will  then  conclude  the
litigation.

     In February  1998, a jury in a Texas state court awarded  compensatory  and
punitive  damages in the aggregate amount of $115 million to former employees of
a steel  company.  The  plaintiffs  had  alleged  that  they  suffered  injuries
following their use of products containing asbestos, sold during 1965 to 1983 by
Carborundum,  a former  subsidiary of BP America Inc. These proceedings have now
been  settled  between  the  parties on the basis of an  annulment  of the court
judgement. Other such claims will be defended vigorously.

     In  February  2000,  the FTC filed a  Complaint  in the US  District  Court
against BP Amoco and ARCO,  seeking a preliminary  injunction to prevent closing
of the combination  transaction between BP Amoco and ARCO. The Attorney Generals
for the Western States also filed  complaints with the same Court.  The Attorney
General for the State of Alaska also joined in the Court  proceedings in support
of the  transaction.  The parties agreed on March 15, 2000, to suspend the Court
proceedings, pending discussions for a consent order.

     In March 2000,  ExxonMobil  filed a Complaint in State Court,  Los Angeles,
seeking  declaratory and injunctive relief and specific  performance  against BP
Amoco,  ARCO and  Phillips  to prevent  the sale of ARCO's  Alaskan  business to
Phillips  referred  to  in  Part  1  --  Recent  Developments  --  The  Proposed
Combination  of BP Amoco and ARCO.  ExxonMobil  allege that the proposed sale to
Phillips  breaches  ExxonMobil's  prior  preferential  rights  to  purchase  the
interests subject to an agreement between  predecessors of ARCO and predecessors
of ExxonMobil  dated  September 23, 1964. BP Amoco  believes that this action is
without merit and will defend the claim vigorously.

ITEM 4 -- CONTROL OF REGISTRANT

       The following  table sets forth certain  shareholding  information  as of
March 24, 2000, concerning the directors and the secretary of BP Amoco p.l.c.

                                       44
<PAGE>
ITEM 5 -- NATURE OF TRADING MARKET

     The primary  market for the Company's  Ordinary  Shares is the London Stock
Exchange.  The  Company's  Ordinary  Shares  are a  constituent  element  of the
Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. The Company's Ordinary Shares are also
traded on stock exchanges in France, Germany, Japan and Switzerland.

     Trading of BP Amoco's shares on the LSE is primarily through the use of the
Stock Exchange  Electronic  Trading Service  (SETS),  introduced in 1997 for the
largest companies in terms of market capitalization whose primary listing is the
LSE.  Under  SETS,  buy and sell  orders at  specific  prices may be sent to the
exchange electronically by any firm which is a member of the LSE, on behalf of a
client or on  behalf  of itself  acting  as a  principal.  The  orders  are then
anonymously  displayed in the order book. When there is a match on a 'buy' and a
'sell'  order,  the trade is  executed  and  automatically  reported to the LSE.
Trading is continuous from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. UK time, but in the event of a
20% movement in the share price  either way the LSE may impose a temporary  halt
in the trading of that  company's  shares in the order book, to allow the market
to re-establish equilibrium.  Dealings in the Company's Ordinary Shares may also
take place between an investor and a  market-maker,  via a member firm,  outside
the electronic order book.

     In the United States and Canada the Company's  securities are traded in the
form of American  Depositary  Shares  (ADSs),  for which Morgan  Guaranty  Trust
Company of New York is the depositary (the Depositary) and transfer agent.  Each
ADS  represents  six  Ordinary  Shares.  ADSs are  listed on the New York  Stock
Exchange,  and are  also  traded  on the  Chicago,  Pacific  and  Toronto  Stock
Exchanges.

     The  Ordinary  Shares  represented  by ADSs  issued  pursuant to the merger
between BP and Amoco were issued in bearer form at the time of the merger. As at
March 24,  2000,  5,411,636,254  Ordinary  Shares in bearer form are held by the
Depositary  in London,  with  32,507,346  Ordinary  Shares  being held by Boston
Equiserve  Limited,  as exchange agent on behalf of Amoco shareholders that have
yet to exchange their Amoco shares for BP Amoco ADSs.

     With  effect  from 4 October  1999,  BP Amoco  subdivided  (or  split)  its
ordinary share capital.  As a result,  the number of ordinary shares held at the
close of business on Friday October 1, 1999 doubled. This resulted in holders of
ADSs receiving a two-for-one stock split.  Therefore,  for every ADS held before
the stock split, a holder received an additional ADS.

     The  following  table sets forth for the periods  indicated the highest and
lowest middle market quotations for the Ordinary Shares of The British Petroleum
Company  p.l.c.  for 1997 and 1998,  and of BP Amoco  p.l.c.  for 1999 and 2000.
These are derived from the Daily  Official  List of the LSE, and the highest and
lowest sales prices of ADSs as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite
tape. The information in this table has been restated to reflect the subdivision
of Ordinary Shares on October 4, 1999.

(a)  An ADS is equivalent to six Ordinary Shares.

     Market prices for the Ordinary Shares on the LSE and in after-hours trading
off the LSE,  in each case while the New York Stock  Exchange  is open,  and the
market prices for ADSs on the New York Stock  Exchange and other North  American
stock exchanges, are closely related due to arbitrage among the various markets,
although  differences  may  exist  from  time to  time  due to  various  factors
including UK stamp duty reserve tax.  Trading in ADSs began on the LSE on August
3, 1987.

     On March 24, 2000,  921,098,875 ADSs (equivalent to 5,526,593,250  Ordinary
Shares  or  some  28.4%  of  the  total)  were  outstanding  and  were  held  by
approximately  121,000 ADR  holders.  Of these,  about  119,000  had  registered
addresses in the USA at that date.

     On March 24,  2000 there were  approximately  372,000  holders of record of
Ordinary Shares. Of these holders,  around 1,200 had registered addresses in the
United States and held a total of some 3,662,000  Ordinary Shares.  In addition,
certain  accounts of record with  registered  addresses other than in the United
States hold Ordinary Shares, in whole or in part, beneficially for United States
persons.

ITEM 6-- EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AFFECTING SECURITY HOLDERS

     There are  currently no UK foreign  exchange  controls or  restrictions  on
remittances  of  dividends  on the  Ordinary  Shares  or on the  conduct  of the
Company's operations.

     There  are no  limitations,  either  under  the laws of the UK or under the
Articles  of  Association  of  BP  Amoco  p.l.c.,   restricting   the  right  of
non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote Ordinary or Preference  Shares in
the Company.

ITEM 7 -- TAXATION

     The following  summary of the principal UK and certain US tax  consequences
of ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares is based in part on  representations  of
Morgan  Guaranty Trust Company of New York as Depositary for the ADRs evidencing
the ADSs and assumes that each  obligation  in the deposit  agreement  among the
Company,  the  Depositary  and the  holders  from  time to time of ADRs  and any
related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.

     Beneficial  owners of ADSs who are  resident  in the USA are treated as the
owners of the  underlying  Ordinary  Shares for the  purposes  of the income tax
convention  between the USA and the UK (the  Convention) and for the purposes of
the US Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  Unless  otherwise
stated,  references to 'shareholders' or 'shareholder'  below are to persons who
are the beneficial owners of the underlying  Ordinary Shares. It should be noted
that the UK Inland Revenue is currently negotiating with the US Internal Revenue
Service about updating and revising the Convention.

UK TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS

POSITION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID BEFORE APRIL 6, 1999

     BP Amoco p.l.c.  was required,  when paying a cash dividend,  to account to
the UK Inland Revenue for a payment of advance  corporation tax (ACT).  The rate
of ACT was 1/4 of the net dividend  (equivalent to 20% of the combined  dividend
and ACT).

     Under UK law, an  individual  shareholder  resident in the UK for UK income
tax  purposes  is  treated  as  having  taxable  income  equal to the sum of any
dividend  paid plus a tax  credit  equal  (before  April 6,  1999) to 1/4 of the
amount of the net  dividend.  The tax credit was available to be set against the
individual's  tax liability on the dividend,  and might in appropriate  cases be
refunded. A UK resident corporate shareholder will not generally be liable to UK
corporation tax on any dividend received.

     Under the Convention,  a beneficial  owner of the Company's  shares who for
the  purposes  of the  Convention  is not a US  corporation  owning  directly or
indirectly 10% or more of the Company's  voting stock,  and who is a resident of
the USA and is not a resident of the UK (a US Holder)  and whose  holding of the
Company's shares is not effectively connected with (i) a permanent establishment
in the UK through which the US Holder carries on a business in the UK, or (ii) a
fixed base from which the US Holder performs  independent  personal  services in
the UK, will  generally  be entitled to receive from the UK Inland  Revenue,  in
addition to any dividend paid by the Company,  an amount equal to the tax credit
available  to  individual  shareholders  resident  in the UK in  respect of such
dividend,  less a  withholding  tax  equal to 15% of the  aggregate  of such tax
credit and such dividend (the Refund).

     For example,  a dividend of $8.00 would entitle such a US Holder to receive
a Refund of $0.50 (a tax credit of $2.00, less a withholding of $1.50), giving a
total net receipt, after UK taxes but before US taxes, of $8.50.

                                       46
<PAGE>
     Special rules may apply under certain circumstances if the US Holder (a) is
exempt  from  tax in the  USA on  dividends  paid by the  Company,  or (b) is an
investment or holding  company,  25% of the capital of which is held directly or
indirectly by one or more persons who are not individual  residents or nationals
of the USA and (i)  which  has  imposed  on it by the  USA,  in  respect  of the
dividend,  a tax substantially less than the tax generally imposed by the USA on
corporate profits, or (ii) which receives more than 80% of its gross income from
sources outside the USA as determined in accordance with the Convention. Special
rules apply to a US Holder who owns 10% or more of the Ordinary Shares and to US
corporate  shareholders which directly or indirectly control,  alone or with one
or more associated corporations, at least 10% of the voting power of the Company
or are residents of the UK.

     Arrangements  existed  with the UK Inland  Revenue  under which a holder of
ADRs resident in the USA that was (i) a US  corporation  whose  business was not
managed and controlled in the UK, (ii) an individual resident in the USA and not
resident in the UK, or (iii) a trust or estate,  all the  beneficiaries of which
were  resident  in the USA,  would  receive  payment of the Refund to which such
holder was entitled,  together  with payment of the  associated  cash  dividend,
provided that the holder was not subject to the special  rules  described in the
preceding  paragraph,  completed the  declaration on the reverse of the dividend
check and presented  the check for payment  within three months from its date of
issue.  The holder had to  declare,  among  other  things,  that he was  neither
engaged in business  nor  performing  independent  personal  services  through a
permanent  establishment  or  fixed  base in the  UK.  These  arrangements  were
terminated by the UK Inland Revenue with effect from April 6, 1999.

     A US Holder  who did not  receive  the  Refund  to which  such US Holder is
entitled  must, in order to obtain  payment,  file in the manner and at the time
described in Revenue  Procedure  80-18,  1980-1 C.B. 623 (as modified by Revenue
Procedure 81-58,  1981-2 C.B. 678 and Revenue Procedure 84-60,  1984-2 C.B. 504,
clarified  and  amplified  by Revenue  Procedure  90-61,  1990-2 C.B. 657 and as
recently modified by Revenue Procedure 2000-13,  2000-6 I.R.B. 515), a claim for
payment  identifying  the dividends  with respect to which the ACT was paid. The
first claim by such a US Holder for a payment is made by sending the appropriate
UK tax form in duplicate to Philadelphia Service Center,  Foreign  Certification
Unit, P.O. Box 16347, DP535B, Philadelphia,  PA19114. Forms may be obtained from
the IRS Assistant Commissioner (International),  950 L'Enfant Plaza South, S.W.,
Washington,  D.C.  20024.  If the US  Holder  qualifies  as a US  resident,  the
Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) will certify the form to that effect and forward
it to the UK tax authorities. Claims must be made within six years of the end of
the UK year of assessment  (generally the 12-month period ending April 5 in each
year) in which the related  dividend was paid. As a claim is not considered made
until the UK tax authorities  receive the  appropriate  form from the IRS, forms
should  be sent to the IRS  well  before  the end of the  applicable  limitation
period.  Any Refund  claim by a US Holder  after the first claim should be filed
directly with the Financial  Intermediaries  and Claims Office  (International),
FitzRoy House, PO Box 46, Nottingham, NG2 1BD, England.

     Whether  shareholders  who  reside  in  countries  other  than  the USA are
entitled to the tax credit in respect of  dividends  on such  shares  depends in
general upon the  provisions  of such  conventions  or  agreements  as may exist
between such countries and the UK. In addition to that with the USA, conventions
or  agreements  presently  exist  between  the UK and,  among  other  countries,
Australia,  Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Luxembourg,  the  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  Norway,
Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

POSITION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID ON OR AFTER APRIL 6, 1999

     The Finance (No 2) Act 1997 introduced new legislation which  significantly
altered the tax  treatment of dividends  paid on or after April 6, 1999. As from
that date the tax credit for an  individual  shareholder  resident  in the UK is
reduced to 1/9 (or 10% of the net dividend plus the tax credit) of the amount of
the net dividend.  This tax credit  continues to be available to set against the
individual's tax liability on the dividend,  but is no longer  refundable to the
individual.

     For a US Holder as defined above this  amendment has the effect of reducing
the  Refund  available  under the  Convention  to nil,  since the  amount of the
withholding  tax (at 15%)  exceeds the 10% tax credit  available  to  individual
shareholders  resident in the UK.  Following the example given above, a dividend
of $8.00 will result in a net  receipt  after UK tax but before US tax of $8.00,
rather than $8.50 (the  withholding  tax does not reduce the dividend  below the
net dividend of $8.00).

     The Finance Act 1998 also abolished the requirement for UK companies to pay
ACT on cash  dividends  as from  April 1,  1999.  This does not  affect  the tax
treatment of dividends described above.

                                       47
<PAGE>
     Dividends  (including  amounts in respect of the tax credit and any amounts
withheld)  must be  included  in gross  income by a  shareholder  subject  to US
taxation and will generally be treated as foreign source 'passive income' or, in
the case of certain US holders,  'financial  services income' for Federal income
tax purposes.  Such  dividends  will generally not be eligible for the dividends
received deduction allowed to US corporations.  The IRS has recently  confirmed,
in Revenue Procedure 2000-13, 2000-6 I.R.B. 515, that, in the case of qualifying
US holders, subject to certain limitations, the UK withholding tax as determined
by the  convention  (i.e. an amount equal to 1/9 of the cash  dividend)  will be
treated as a foreign  income tax that is  eligible  for  credit  against  the US
holders' federal income tax. To qualify for such credit, US holders must make an
election on Form 8833 (Treaty-Based Return Position  Disclosure),  which must be
filed  with their tax  return,  in  addition  to any other  filings  that may be
required.  At the end of the calendar  year during which the dividends are paid,
US holders will receive a Form 1099 confirming the amount of dividends received.

SHARE DIVIDEND CHOICE FOR BP AMOCO ADR HOLDERS

     ADR holders electing to receive ADSs instead of a cash dividend (see Item 8
- -- Selected Financial Data -- Dividends) will not be entitled to any Refund from
the UK Inland Revenue,  nor will the 15% withholding tax apply,  with respect to
such dividends.

     For US tax  purposes  the receipt of  additional  ADSs will be treated as a
dividend  distribution.  An  ADR  holder  who is  subject  to US  taxation  will
generally  be treated as having  received  gross income equal to the fair market
value of the ADSs (or fraction thereof) on the date of the share distribution in
London (with no reduction for the stamp duty reserve tax referred to below). The
US resident  ADR holder will  receive a tax basis in the ADSs equal to such fair
market  value.  Corporations  will  not  be  entitled  to a  dividends  received
deduction on receipt of a share dividend.

FOREIGN INCOME DIVIDENDS

     The Finance Act 1994 introduced new legislation  under which companies were
able on or after July 1, 1994 to elect to pay a 'foreign  income  dividend' with
special tax  treatment.  ACT would be payable by the Company on such a dividend,
but surplus ACT not creditable  against  mainstream  corporation tax liabilities
may be repayable to the Company later, based on the extent to which the dividend
was shown to have been paid out of  sufficiently  taxed foreign source  profits.
Shareholders would obtain no tax credit.  However,  they would be treated for UK
tax purposes as having  received income which had suffered tax at 20%. No Refund
would be available to US Holders in respect of any such dividends.  BP Amoco did
not elect to pay a foreign income dividend.

     The  Finance  (No.  2)  Act  1997  repealed  the  foreign  income  dividend
legislation with effect from April 6, 1999.

UK TAXATION OF CAPITAL GAINS

     A US Holder will be liable to UK tax on capital gains  realized on the sale
or other  disposition of Ordinary  Shares only if the US Holder is resident (or,
in the case of an individual, ordinarily resident) for UK tax purposes in the UK
or if he  carries  on a  trade,  profession  or  vocation  in the UK  through  a
permanent establishment and the Ordinary Shares are (i) used for the purposes of
the trade,  profession  or  vocation,  or (ii) used,  held or  acquired  for the
purposes of the permanent establishment.

     The liability to UK capital gains tax for US holders of ADRs is the same as
that for a US holder of Ordinary Shares,  except that a US holder of ADRs who is
resident but not domiciled in the UK will not be taxed on gains  realized on the
sale or other disposition of ADSs if the proceeds are not remitted to the UK.

UK INHERITANCE TAX

     UK capital transfer tax was restructured and renamed  'inheritance  tax' in
1986.  The US-UK double  taxation  convention  relating to estate and gift taxes
(the  Estate  Tax  Convention)  applies  to  inheritance  tax.  ADRs  held by an
individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the
USA and is not for the  purposes of the Estate Tax  Convention a national of the
UK will not be subject to  inheritance  tax on death or on  transfer  during the
individual's  lifetime  unless,  among  other  things,  the ADSs are part of the
business property of a permanent  establishment situated in the UK or pertain to
a fixed base situated in the UK used for the performance of independent personal
services. In the exceptional case where ADSs are subject both to inheritance tax
and to US  Federal  gift or estate  tax,  the Estate  Tax  Convention  generally
provides for tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax payable in the USA or
for tax paid in the USA to be  credited  against  tax payable in the UK based on
priority rules set forth in the Estate Tax Convention.

                                       48
<PAGE>
UK STAMP DUTY AND STAMP DUTY RESERVE TAX

     The  statements  below  relate  to what  is  understood  to be the  current
practice of the UK Inland Revenue under existing law.

     Provided  that the  instrument  of transfer  is not  executed in the UK and
remains at all times  outside  the UK, and the  transfer  does not relate to any
matter or thing done or to be done in the UK, no UK stamp duty is payable on the
acquisition  or transfer of ADSs.  Neither will an agreement to transfer ADSs in
the form of ADRs give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.

     Purchases of Ordinary Shares, as opposed to ADSs,  through the CREST system
of paperless share transfers will be subject to stamp duty reserve tax at a rate
of 0.5%. The charge will arise as soon as there is an agreement for the transfer
of the shares (or, in the case of a conditional agreement, when the condition is
fulfilled).  The stamp duty  reserve  tax will apply to  agreements  to transfer
Ordinary  Shares  even if the  agreement  is made  outside  the UK  between  two
non-residents. Purchases of Ordinary Shares outside the CREST system are subject
either to stamp  duty at a rate of 50 pence per L100 (or  part),  or stamp  duty
reserve tax at 0.5%.  Stamp duty and stamp duty  reserve tax are  generally  the
liability  of the  purchaser.  A subsequent  transfer of Ordinary  Shares to the
Depositary's  nominee will give rise to further  stamp duty at the rate of L1.50
per L100 (or part) or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5% of the value of
the Ordinary Shares at the time of the transfer.

     A  transfer  of  the  underlying  Ordinary  Shares  to an ADR  holder  upon
cancellation of the ADSs without transfer of beneficial ownership will give rise
to UK stamp duty at the rate of 50 pence per transfer  (which is increased to L5
in the 1999 UK budget).

     An ADR holder  electing to receive ADSs instead of a cash  dividend will be
responsible  for the  stamp  duty  reserve  tax due on  issue of  shares  to the
Depositary's  nominee and  calculated  at the rate of 1.5% on the issue price of
the shares.  Current UK Inland Revenue  practice is to calculate the issue price
by reference to the total cash receipt  (i.e.  cash  dividend plus the Refund if
any) to which a US Holder  would have been  entitled had the election to receive
ADSs instead of a cash dividend not been made.  ADR holders  electing to receive
ADSs instead of the cash dividend  authorize the  Depositary to sell  sufficient
shares to cover this liability.

(a)  Operating profit is a UK GAAP measure of trading  performance.  It excludes
     profits  and  losses  on the  sale  of  businesses  and  fixed  assets  and
     fundamental restructuring costs, interest expense and taxation.

      BP Amoco determines  operating  profit on a replacement cost basis,  which
      eliminates the effect of inventory  holding gains and losses.  For the oil
      and gas  industry,  the  price of crude  oil can vary  significantly  from
      period to period; hence the value of crude oil (and products) also varies.
      As a  consequence,  the amount that would be charged to cost of sales on a
      first-in,  first-out (FIFO) basis of inventory valuation would include the
      effect of oil price fluctuations on oil and products inventories. BP Amoco
      therefore charges cost of sales with the average cost of supplies incurred
      during the period  rather than the  historical  cost of supplies on a FIFO
      basis.  For this  purpose,  inventories  at the  beginning  and end of the
      period are valued at the  average  cost of  supplies  incurred  during the
      period rather than at their  historical  cost.  These  valuations are made
      quarterly  by each  business  unit,  based on local oil and product  price
      indices  applicable  to their  specific  inventory  holdings,  following a
      methodology that has been consistently applied by BP Amoco for many years.
      Operating  profit  on the  replacement  cost  basis  is used  by BP  Amoco
      management as the primary measure of business unit trading performance and
      BP Amoco management believes that this measure assists investors to assess
      BP Amoco's underlying trading performance from period to period.

      Replacement  cost is not a US GAAP  measure.  The  major US oil  companies
      apply the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis of inventory valuation. The LIFO
      basis is not permitted under UK GAAP. The LIFO basis eliminates the effect
      of price  fluctuations on crude oil and product  inventory except where an
      inventory  drawdown occurs in a period. BP Amoco management  believes that
      where inventory volumes remain constant or increase in a period, operating
      profit on the LIFO basis will not differ  materially from operating profit
      on BP Amoco's replacement cost basis.

      Where an inventory  drawdown  occurs in a period,  cost of sales on a LIFO
      basis will be charged  with the  historical  cost of the  inventory  drawn
      down,  whereas BP Amoco's  replacement cost basis charges cost of sales at
      the  average  cost of  supplies  for the  period.  To the extent  that the
      historical  cost on the LIFO  basis of the  inventory  drawn down is lower
      than the current cost of supplies in the period,  operating  profit on the
      LIFO basis will be greater than operating profit on BP Amoco's replacement
      cost basis.  To the extent that the  historical  cost on the LIFO basis of
      the inventory drawdown is greater than the current cost of supplies in the
      period  operating  profit on the LIFO basis  will be lower than  operating
      profit on BP Amoco's replacement cost basis.

(b)  Replacement  cost profit  before  exceptional  items  excludes  profits and
     losses  on  the  sale  of  businesses  and  fixed  assets  and  fundamental
     restructuring  costs,  which are defined by UK GAAP. This is the measure of
     profit  used by the BP Amoco board in setting  targets  for and  monitoring
     performance within BP Amoco. BP Amoco's management  believes this indicator
     provides the most relevant and useful measure for investors because it most
     accurately reflects underlying trading performance.

(c)  With  effect  from  October  4,  1999 BP Amoco  split (or  subdivided)  its
     ordinary share capital.  As a result, the number of Ordinary Shares held at
     the close of business on Friday  October 1, 1999,  doubled,  and holders of
     ADSs received a two-for-one  stock split.  Comparative  figures for 1995 to
     1998 inclusive have been restated accordingly.

(d)  BP Amoco dividends per share represent  historical dividends per share paid
     by BP for 1995 to 1998 inclusive.

(e)  Finance debt due after more than one year,  compared with such debt plus BP
     Amoco and minority shareholders' interests.

(f)  The net cash inflows from operating  activities are presented in accordance
     with the requirements of Financial  Reporting Standard No. 1 (Revised 1996)
     issued by the UK  Accounting  Standards  Board.  For a cash flow  statement
     prepared  on a US GAAP  basis see Item 18 -- Note 44 of Notes to  Financial
     Statements.

(g)  FASB Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 128--  'Earnings per
     Share' (SFAS 128) was adopted for the accounting period ending December 31,
     1997. Amounts for prior periods have been restated as required by SFAS 128.

(h)  With  effect  from  June 6,  1997  the  Company  split  existing  ADSs on a
     two-for-one  basis so that an ADS is now equivalent to six Ordinary Shares.
     Comparative figures for 1995 and 1996 have been restated accordingly.

(i)  The Group has  adopted  Financial  Reporting  Standard  No.12  `Provisions,

     BP p.l.c. paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares in each year since 1917. In
1999, there was a dividend payment in February to holders of BP p.l.c.  Ordinary
Shares and ADSs as at November 13, 1998. There were further dividend payments in
April, June, September and December to harmonize payment dates for former BP and
Amoco shareholders. In 2000 and thereafter,  dividends will be paid quarterly in
March, June, September and December. Until their shares have been exchanged into
the form of BP Amoco ADSs,  Amoco  Shareholders do not have the right to receive
dividends.

     BP Amoco  announces  dividends on Ordinary  Shares in US dollars and at the
same time states an equivalent sterling dividend.  Prior to the fourth quarterly
dividend of 1998 BP p.l.c.  announced  dividends in sterling.  Foreign  exchange
rates may  affect  dividends  paid.  However,  when  setting  the  dividend  the
directors are mindful of dividend fluctuation in sterling terms.

     The following  table shows  dividends  announced by the Company per ADS for
each of the past five years,  together  with the Refund but before  deduction of
withholding  taxes as  described  in Item 7 --  Taxation.  Dividends  have  been
translated from pounds per ADS up to and including the third quarterly  dividend
for 1998, and from dollars per ADS for the fourth quarterly dividend of 1998, at
an exchange  rate in London on the business day last  preceding the day when the
directors  announced  their  intention to pay the quarterly  dividends for those
years.

     The Group has  adopted  Financial  Reporting  Standard  No.12  `Provisions,
Contingent  Liabilities and Contingent  Assets' with effect from January 1,1999.
Comparative figures for 1998 and 1997 have been restated accordingly.

     BP Amoco's 1999 operating performance reflected the substantial benefits of
restructuring and integration  following the merger,  together with ongoing cost
control.  The trading  environment was broadly neutral,  with higher average oil
prices substantially offset by weaker downstream and chemicals margins. European
currencies were significantly  weaker and sterling was marginally weaker against
the US dollar in 1999.

     As well as reporting net income (profit after  inventory  holding gains and
losses, calculated on a first-in,  first-out basis), and after exceptional items
(as  defined  by UK  GAAP:  profits  and  losses  on sale  and  termination  and
fundamental restructuring costs), BP Amoco also reports results on a replacement
cost basis (excluding inventory holding gains and losses) and before exceptional
items.  In addition the Group  discloses  the amount and nature of special items
which  are  non-recurring  charges  and  credits  that  are  not  classified  as
exceptional  items under UK GAAP,  and discloses  also  replacement  cost profit
before  exceptional items, after adjusting for these special items. This is done
in order to provide a more comparable basis to the results and disclosures of US
companies  and  to  indicate  underlying  trading  performance   undistorted  by
significant  restructuring,  integration  and other one-off charges and credits.
Both  exceptional  and  special  charges  have  been  significant  in 1999.  The
discussion below addresses each of these various measures and disclosures.

     In 1999,  replacement cost profit before  exceptional items (which excludes
inventory  holding  gains and losses) was $5,330  million  compared  with $3,959
million in 1998,  representing  an increase  of 35%. In addition to  exceptional
items (as identified under UK GAAP),  these results included net special charges
of $1,210  million  ($876  million  after  tax) in 1999 and $597  million  ($469
million after tax) in 1998. The major  components of the special charges in 1999
were  integration  costs,  costs  associated with the  restructuring  programme,
write-downs  in respect of asset  impairments  and  project  costs in respect of
process  improvement  and  outsourcing.  The special  charges in 1998  consisted
principally of write-downs in respect of asset impairments.  After adjusting for
these  special  charges,  the 1999 result was 40% higher than that of 1998.  The
return on average  capital  employed,  based on  replacement  cost profit before
exceptional  items, was 12% (13% on an adjusted basis)  representing an increase
of three  percentage  points over 1998. The historical  cost profit for 1999 was
$5,008  million  including  inventory  holding  gains of  $1,728  million.  This
compared with a profit of $3,220 million in 1998 after inventory  holding losses
of $1,391 million.  There were net exceptional  losses of $2,280 million ($2,050
million after tax) in 1999 compared with net exceptional profits in 1998 of $850
million ($652 million after tax).

                                       54
<PAGE>
     In 1999 the net  exceptional  losses of $2,280 million before tax comprised
restructuring  costs of $1,943 million and a net loss on sales of businesses and
fixed assets or  termination  of operations of $337 million.  The  restructuring
costs arose from restructuring activity across the Group following the merger of
BP and  Amoco at the end of 1998 and  relate  predominantly  to the  Group's  US
operations.  The main areas of activity were the  elimination  of duplication in
the former BP and Amoco  operations  and ongoing  restructuring  to adapt to the
changing business environment,  and some further outsourcing. The major elements
of the restructuring charges comprised employee severance costs ($1,212 million)
and  provisions  to cover future  rental  payments on surplus  leasehold  office
accommodation   and  other  property  ($297  million).   Also  included  in  the
restructuring  charges were office closure costs,  contract termination payments
and asset write-offs.  The cash outflow for these  restructuring  charges during
1999 was $976 million.

     During 1999,  some 16,000  employees  left the Group  through  severance or
outsourcing  arrangements.  Of these,  some  13,000  were based in the USA.  The
reductions arose mainly in Houston, Texas; Chicago,  Illinois; and Cleveland and
Warrensville, Ohio. Approximately 4,000 more employees had received notification
of the  termination  of their  employment by the end of 1999 and are expected to
leave the Group in 2000.

     Sales  of  businesses  and  fixed  assets  in  1999  included  the  sale of
distribution  terminals and service  stations in the USA mandated by the Federal
Trade Commission in connection with the BP Amoco merger. Following completion of
the  merger on  December  31,  1998 and in the  context of low oil prices at the
time, BP Amoco  undertook a strategic and portfolio  review in early 1999.  This
was  completed in the Spring of 1999 and resulted,  among other  things,  in the
development of an asset divestment programme.

     The  guiding  principle  of  the  strategic  and  portfolio  review  was to
concentrate  the combined  Group's  operations on areas of competitive  strength
and, in the upstream portfolio, to dispose of assets which would not be robustly
economic on the basis of conservative assumptions about future oil prices. Under
this programme the Group disposed of its Canadian oil  properties,  its interest
in the Pedernales oil field in Venezuela and certain chemicals operations.

       In 1998,  financial  performance  was affected by general price deflation
and  erosion  of  margins,  with a 34%  fall in  average  oil  realizations  and
deterioration  in both the downstream and chemicals  environments.  Productivity
improvements,  cost  savings  and higher  sales  volumes  partially  offset this
significant downturn in the operating environment.

     The US dollar was relatively stable against European currencies in 1998. In
1997 most  currencies  declined  against the dollar,  except for sterling  which
strengthened to an average of $1.64/L1 from $1.56/L1 in 1996.

     Replacement cost profit before  exceptional items (which excludes inventory
holding  gains and  losses)  for 1998 was $3,959  million  compared  with $6,622
million in 1997, a fall of 40%. In addition to  exceptional  items these results
included net special  charges of $597 million  ($469  million after tax) in 1998
and $133 million ($106 million after tax) in 1997.  The special  charges in both
years  consisted  principally of  write-downs  in respect of asset  impairments.
After excluding these special  charges,  the 1998 result was 34% lower than that
of 1997.  The 1998 results  reflected  the then new  requirement  to  capitalize
certain information  technology expenditure of a type which had been expensed in
previous years. The amount capitalized in 1998 was some $160 million. The return
on average capital employed, based on replacement cost profit before exceptional
items,  was 9%  compared  to 14% in 1997.  On an  adjusted  basis the  return on
average capital employed was 10% in 1998 compared to 14% in 1997.

     The  historical  cost profit for 1998 was $3,220  million  after  inventory
holding losses of $1,391 million.  This compared with a profit of $5,673 million
after  inventory  holding  losses of $939 million for 1997. The results for 1998
included net exceptional profits of $850 million ($652 million after tax); those
of 1997 included net exceptional profits of $128 million ($10 million loss after
tax).

     In 1998 sales of businesses  and fixed assets  generated net profits before
tax of $1,048  million.  The principal  sales were  exploration  and  production
properties in the USA and Papua New Guinea, the refinery in Lima, Ohio, the sale
and leaseback of the Amoco building in Chicago,  Illinois, the retail network in
the  Czech  Republic,  the  Adibis  fuel  additives  business  and a  speciality
chemicals distribution business.  Also included was the disposal by the BP/Mobil
joint venture of its retail network in Belgium. Merger transaction costs of $198
million in respect of advisers' fees and expenses were incurred in 1998.

<PAGE>
     The major  elements of the net profit  before tax on the sale of businesses
and fixed assets in 1997 of $440 million  were the sales of US  exploration  and
production  properties and an intrastate natural gas pipeline unit in Texas. The
loss on sale of businesses by joint ventures relates principally to the costs of
the BP/Mobil  joint venture  terminating  base oil  manufacturing  operations at
Llandarcy in the UK. Also in 1997,  there was a net charge for refinery  network
rationalization  of $47  million  which  represented  the  balance  of the costs
associated  with  the  rationalization  of the BP  Amoco  Group's  international
refining  system  announced  in 1995.  In  addition,  there were  one-off  costs
associated  with the  setting-up of the European  refining and  marketing  joint
venture  with Mobil  amounting  to $265  million.  These costs  represented  the
Group's  share of charges for  severance,  restructuring,  rebranding  and other
implementation charges.

     Capital  expenditure  and  acquisitions in 1999 amounted to $7,345 million,
29% down on 1998,  reflecting  greater focus in the capital programme  following
the merger.  Expenditure in 1999 included $400 million in respect of the Group's
purchase of a significant  part of Repsol YPF's share of assets in the Crescendo
Resources partnership. Disposal proceeds, arising primarily from the post-merger
asset divestment programme,  amounted to $2,441 million. Capital expenditure net
of divestments was $4,904 million (1998 $8,195  million).  Within the context of
the Group's targets,  capital  expenditure in 2000 is projected to be around $10
billion,  excluding significant acquisitions,  reflecting the businesses' growth
agenda underpinned by continuing discipline in the capital programme.

     The total dividends announced for 1999 were $3,884 million,  against $4,121
million for 1998. 1998 dividends included a second fourth-quarterly  dividend to
former Amoco  shareholders to harmonize timing of quarterly dividend payments as
a result of the merger.  Dividends per share for 1999 were 20.0 cents ($1.20 per
ADS) compared with 19.8 cents per share ($1.19 per ADS) for 1998. The Group also
intends to continue the operation of the Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan (DRIP) for
shareholders  who wish to receive  their  dividend in the form of shares  rather
than  cash.  The DRIP was  introduced  in 1999 to  replace  the  previous  share
dividend  plan  which  was  terminated  owing  to the  abolition  of UK  advance
corporation  tax. The BP Amoco Direct Access Plan for US and Canadian  investors
also includes a dividend reinvestment feature.

     The Group will seek  authority from  shareholders  at the April 2000 annual
general meeting for the repurchase and cancellation of shares up to a maximum of
1,948,600,000  Ordinary Shares  (approximately  10% of the ordinary issued share
capital at December 31,  1999).  This will allow share  buybacks as and when the
Group's funding position permits.

BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS

     Total  replacement  cost  operating  profit,  which is  arrived  at  before
inventory  holding  gains and losses,  interest  expense,  taxation and minority
interests,  and before  exceptional  items,  was $8,894 million in 1999,  $6,521
million in 1998 and $10,683  million in 1997. The business  results which follow
are presented on this basis.

     The replacement cost operating  profit for 1999 was $7,194,  an improvement
of 123% over the equivalent  result of 1998. After adjusting for special charges
of $299 million,  the adjusted result of $7,493 million  represented an increase
of 102% on the adjusted  result of $3,716 million for 1998.  Special  charges in
1998 amounted to $485 million.  Oil realizations  were $4.68 a barrel higher and
North  American  natural  gas  prices  were 13% above  their 1998  level.  These
environmental benefits were significantly complemented by cost savings.

     Oil production increased slightly compared with 1998, with rising output in
the Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP) in the North Sea and at Schiehallion  and
Foinaven,  west of Shetland,  more than offsetting declines in Alaska and in the
more mature  North Sea fields,  and the effect of the sale of our  Canadian  oil
interests.  Natural gas production increased 4.5% to just over 6 bcf/d following
the start-up of a $1-billion liquefied natural gas plant in Trinidad.

     In 1999,  finding  and  development  costs  averaged  $3.3 a barrel  of oil
equivalent,  representing  a  substantial  reduction  on the $4.70 per barrel in
1998. Lifting costs averaged $2.7 a barrel of oil equivalent, compared with $3.2
in 1998.

     In  1998  our  upstream  business   performed  well  in  a  most  difficult
environment.  Replacement cost operating profit of $3,231 million, represented a
decline of 56% (50% after adjusting for net special charges) compared with 1997.
Brent  North Sea oil  averaged  $6.4 a barrel  below the 1997 level  while North
American natural gas prices were some 40 cents per thousand cubic feet below the
1997 average.  The special  charges of $485 million  principally  comprised $200
million for the  write-down  of the Group's  investment  in A O Sidanco and $104
million for the  impairment  of the Opon field and $110 million for the adjacent
power plant in Colombia.

     Increased  production  volumes,  coupled  with a sustained  focus on costs,
boosted this  performance.  Production grew 3.7% to 3,050 mboe/d.  Production of
oil,  condensate  and natural  gas liquid  increased  by 6.2% to 2,049  thousand
barrels a day (mb/d) from 1,930 mb/d in 1997,  while natural gas production fell
0.9% to 5,808  million  standard  cubic feet a day  (mmcf/d)  from 5,858  mmcf/d
because of the decline at older UK offshore fields.

     The production growth in 1998 was supported by strong  performance from our
1997 start-ups,  and completion of a large number of new projects in 1998. These
included  ETAP,  Viking  Phoenix,  Brown  and Bruce  Phase 2 in the  North  Sea;
Schiehallion and Loyal, west of Shetland;  Hugoton natural gas plant in the USA;
the second phase of development of the Cusiana/Cupiagua project in Colombia; and
Pedernales phase 2 in Venezuela.  Start-up of these projects contributed towards
the transfer of 1.38 billion  barrels of oil equivalent of reserves to developed
status.

     In  1999,   Exploration  and  Production's  reserves  replacement  exceeded
production for the sixth  consecutive  year,  with 1,172 million  barrels of oil
equivalent  added to proved  reserves.  The  proportion  of gas in these reserve
additions was similar to that of 1998 at about 66%.

     Technological  innovation  underpinned  our  most  significant  exploration
achievement in 1999 - the discovery of the largest  deepwater field so far found
in the Gulf of Mexico,  the Crazy  Horse  field,  in which the Group holds a 75%
interest. Finding this field involved drilling through 1,800 metres (6,000 feet)
of water  and more than 600  metres  (2,000  feet) of salt to a record  depth of
7,830 metres (25,770 feet).

     Crazy Horse was only one of a number of major finds in 1999. In the Gulf of
Mexico we announced the discovery of three other fields - Holstein, Atlantis and
Mad Dog. In Angola our exploration success continued with eight new discoveries.
Elsewhere there were large natural gas finds in Azerbaijan's offshore waters and
in Australia's  North West Shelf.  In December  1999, a consortium,  in which BP
Amoco  has a 35%  interest,  announced  that it had been  awarded  a deep  water
concession  offshore  Brazil,  the BFZ-2 block.  This will be BP Amoco's  second
operatorship in the area.

     Also in December 1999, BP Amoco and Repsol YPF dissolved their partnership,
Crescendo  Resources,  a major gas producer and processor in Texas and Oklahoma,
USA.  Subsequently,  BP Amoco purchased a significant part of Repsol YPF's share
of the assets from the partnership.

                                       57
<PAGE>
     During 1998,  discoveries  occurred in many parts of the world. Our success
in Angola  continued with new finds in Kissanje,  Marimba,  Hungo and Dikanza in
Block 15. In South America,  there was a successful discovery at the Tropical-1X
well on the  Quiriquire  block in  Venezuela,  in which we have a 45% stake.  In
Norway,  the Barden  well  confirmed  significant  natural  gas  reserves in the
Southern  extension of the Ormen Lange Dome.  Other  substantial oil and natural
gas discoveries were made off the coast of Trinidad and in Egypt, Canada and the
USA.

     Capital  expenditure and  acquisitions  decreased to $4,212 million in 1999
from $6,318 million in 1998.

     In 2000,  projects  coming on stream are  expected to include  Amherstia in
Trinidad  and Ha'py and Baltim in Egypt.  In  addition,  there  should be a full
year's production from new developments in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

     In 1999,  Refining and  Marketing  achieved a highly  competitive  adjusted
return (i.e.  before special charges) on fixed assets of 10% despite  plummeting
margins  in  refining,  which  fell by 48%  compared  with  the  previous  year.
Replacement  cost operating  profit of $1,840 million  represented a decrease of
28%  compared  with 1998.  After  adjusting to exclude  special  charges of $242
million,  Refining and Marketing's  replacement cost operating profit was $2,082
million a decrease of 19% compared with 1998,  reflecting  the rise in the price
of crude oil and refined  products and  consequent  tightening  of margins.  The
deterioration  in the  refining  environment  led to run  cuts  at a  number  of
refineries.  The pressure on marketing  margins  reflected rising product prices
which could not be fully  recovered in the market.  Significant  cost reductions
moderated the effect of the harsher trading environment.

       Retail  volumes rose while shop  revenues  grew faster than the market at
6%,  reflecting the strength of our  convenience  retail business in the USA and
UK. More than 170 new retail sites were opened  worldwide  during the year, with
90 opened  in  Poland,  China,  Venezuela  and  Russia.  Growth in our  aviation
business  was strong,  and Air BP was  recognized  as the World's  Best Jet Fuel
Marketer by an authoritative industry survey.

       1998  was a year  of  strong  performance  for the  downstream  business.
Underlying  performance  delivered total  replacement  cost operating  profit of
$2,564 million, an increase of 12% over 1997, with a competitive return on fixed
assets  of 12%.  This  outcome  was  achieved  in  spite  of  difficult  trading
conditions,  characterized by reduced refining margins in the second half of the
year and the  impact of  economic  slowdown  in our  growth  markets.  1998 also
benefited from the  capitalization  of IT expenditure of $70 million which would
have been expensed in earlier periods.

       Marketing  volumes rose in 1998 in spite of  divestments  across both the
retail and commercial segments,  with continued  improvement flowing from our US
and European operations.  The retail business grew during the year, with volumes
up 3%. The focus on growing our convenience retailing activity as one of our key
strategic objectives  continued.  The 'Split Second' US convenience store format
was  rolled  out  in  Atlanta,  Georgia;  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania;  Chicago,
Illinois;  Denver,  Colorado and south Florida,  with high customer satisfaction
ratings.  Our commercial marketing activities continued to deliver strong growth
in income with the drive towards customer-focused marketing solutions.

       In 1998,  despite lower overall  margins our refining  business  achieved
good results.  A combination of cost savings and improved  operating  efficiency
produced a 12% improvement in total  replacement  cost operating profit compared
with 1997.

     Capital expenditure in 1999 was $1,634 million compared with $1,937 million
in  1998.  The  Group's  capital  expenditure  on  refinery  assets,   including
environmental  expenditures and investments in line with regulatory requirements
to improve  product  quality,  totalled  $607 million in 1999 compared with $685
million in 1998.  During the year we completed the  repositioning  of our Toledo
refinery (to allow it to run on cheaper, heavy crudes) with the commissioning of
a new  coker  unit and we began a  project  at  Sines,  Portugal,  to  develop a
liquefied  petroleum gas storage cavern facility.  During the year we also began
to upgrade our Bulwer Island refinery near Brisbane,  Australia,  to allow it to
produce low sulphur fuels. This was one of a number of initiatives undertaken as
part of our drive for cleaner fuels.  Capital  expenditure  on marketing  assets
amounted to $1,027  million in 1999 compared with $1,252 million in the previous
year.

     In December  1999,  we announced  that BP Amoco had agreed with  ExxonMobil
Corporation the principles under which their European fuels and lubricants joint
venture would be dissolved in response to the European Commission's  requirement
in  respect  of the Exxon  and Mobil  merger.  Under  the  agreement  - which is
conditional on a number of approvals from national  governments  and appropriate
employee consultation - BP Amoco will purchase Mobil's 30% interest in the fuels
business for around $1.5 billion,  subject to adjustments.  In addition, the two
companies will divide the assets of the lubricants business broadly in line with
their equity stakes (51% Mobil,  49% BP Amoco).  In February  2000, the European
Union's Merger Task Force gave its approval to the dissolution.

     Chemicals' replacement cost operating profit was $686 million compared with
$1,100 million in 1998, a decrease of 38%. After  adjustment for special charges
of $247  million,  Chemicals'  profit  of $933  million  in 1999  represented  a
decrease of 19% compared with the adjusted  result of 1998 despite a 6% increase
in production. Special charges in 1998 amounted to $50 million.

     Chemicals  margins in several  commodity product areas fell to levels below
the low points  seen in  previous  cycles.  At the same time the  effects of the
financial  crisis in Asia  continued  to be felt,  especially  in Europe,  where
weakness of the euro also  contributed  to pressure  on  margins.  This  adverse
external  environment  was offset  partially by a clear focus on cost reductions
and releasing  the value of the merger of BP and Amoco.  Total volume of product
manufactured  rose by 6% to an  all-time  record of 21.9  million  tonnes as new
capacity came on stream and production reliability increased. These increases in
production were partly offset by disposals.

     In 1998, margins for most commodity  chemicals  deteriorated  compared with
1997. This reflected increased industry capacity,  weak demand in Europe and the
financial  crisis in Asia.  These  factors  were  offset  to some  extent by our
continued focus on self-help  initiatives,  such as cost  reduction,  and by the
benefits of our investment in proprietary technology.

     The total volume of product  manufactured  rose by 6% in 1998,  principally
reflecting  our  styrenics  acquisition  in early 1998. As a result of all these
factors total replacement cost operating profit was $1,100 million compared with
$1,530 million in 1997.

     In 1999 we  disposed  of the Verdugt  acid salts  business  in Europe,  the
Plaskon electronic materials business based in the USA and Singapore,  our share
of the olefins  cracker in Wilton,  UK, the US Fibers and Yarns business and the
Plaspack  Kunststoffe plastic net and webbing business and we completed the sale
and  leaseback of railcars in the USA. In addition,  we announced the closure of
our joint-venture  Singapore aromatics complex. In 2000, BP Amoco refinanced the
entity's bank loans and sold its interest in the entity to ExxonMobil, resulting
in a loss of $218 million ($148 million after tax).

     In 1998,  divestments  included the Adibis  lubricants  and fuel  additives
business  and  speciality  chemicals  distribution   businesses  in  Europe  and
Australasia.  During  1997 BP Amoco sold its  advanced  materials  and  phenolic
resins business in the UK.

     Capital  expenditure and  acquisitions in 1999 was $1,215 million  compared
with $1,606 million in 1998.

     In 1999, a number of new  chemicals  projects  aimed at  strengthening  our
portfolio  were  sanctioned or announced,  including a new 250,000 tonnes a year
linear alpha-olefins plant in Alberta,  Canada, and the expansion of trimellitic

     In China our  150,000-tonnes-a-year  acetic acid joint venture with Sinopec
at Yaraco was commissioned early in the year. Another joint venture with Sinopec
- - the detailed  planning phase of a world-scale  900,000-tonnes-a-year  ethylene
cracker and derivative  product units near Shanghai - received official approval
in the Autumn. Start-up is expected in 2005.

     During 1998 we acquired Styrenix  Kunststoffe.  Projects  completed in 1998
included the purified  terephthalic acid unit and paraxylene unit at Geel, a new
metaxylene  plant at Texas City, and the first stage of the planned $825 million
investment programme in the UK.

     The net cost of Other  Businesses  and  Corporate in 1999  amounted to $826
million.  This included  special charges of $398 million.  The net cost of Other
Businesses  and  Corporate  of $374  million for 1998  included  $50 million for
integration  costs in respect of the BP Amoco merger.  1998  benefited  from the
capitalization of IT expenditure  amounting to $65 million which would have been
expensed in earlier periods.

INTEREST EXPENSE

     Interest  expense was $1,316 million  compared with $1,177 million in 1998.
These  amounts   included  special  charges  of  $24  million  and  $12  million
respectively,  arising from the early  redemption of bonds.  After adjusting for
these special charges,  the increase in Group interest expense in 1999 reflected
lower  capitalized  interest and higher  average debt, the effects of which were
partly offset by lower interest rates.

     Interest expense in 1998 was $1,177 million compared with $1,035 million in
1997.  The  increase  reflected  higher  average  debt,  partly  offset by lower
interest rates.

TAXATION

     The charge for  corporate  taxes in 1999 was $1,880  million  compared with
$1,520  million in 1998,  and $3,013  million in 1997. The effective tax rate on
historical  cost profit was 27% in 1999,  32% in 1998 and 34% in 1997. The lower
rate in 1999 reflected the effect of inventory holding gains not taxed,  whereas
in 1998 there were unrelieved  inventory holding losses; this difference between
the two  years  was  partly  offset  by the  relatively  low tax  relief  on net
exceptional losses in 1999 and the absence of tax credits in 1998.

     The effective tax rate on replacement cost profit before  exceptional items
was 28%,  compared  with 25% in 1998 and 30% in 1997.  The increase in effective
rate in 1999 over 1998  reflected the effects of tax on inventory  holding gains
which do not form part of the replacement cost profit before  exceptional items.
The reduction from 1997 to 1998 reflected the effects of tax relief on inventory
holding losses and timing benefits.

Net cash inflow from operating activities...................  10,290     9,586     15,558
Net cash (outflow) inflow...................................     (82)     (906)       878
</TABLE>

     Net cash  outflow for 1999 was $82 million  compared  with $906  million in
1998.  The change  reflected  improved  operating  results and lower net capital
expenditure,  partly offset by  restructuring  and integration  costs and higher
dividend payments.

     Net cash inflow from operating  activities  increased to $10,290 million in
1999 from $9,586  million in 1998.  The main  factors in this  improvement  were
increased  operating  earnings  offset to a large  extent by an  increase in the
funding requirement for working capital caused by the increase in oil prices.

     Dividends from joint ventures and  associated  undertakings  increased from
$966 million in 1998 to $1,168  million in 1999.  The  principal  factor in this
increase was improved  results from the BP/Mobil joint venture  partially offset
by a decrease in  dividends  from other  associated  undertakings.  The net cash
outflow  from  servicing  of finance and return from  investments  increased  to
$1,003  million  from $825  million in 1998,  principally  as a result of higher
interest  payments  being made on the higher average level of debt. Tax payments
fell from $1,705 million in 1998 to $1,260  million in 1999  reflecting a degree
of lag in the timing of tax payments.

     Payments  for capital  expenditures  on fixed  assets net of proceeds  from
sales of fixed assets, amounted to $5,385 million, a reduction of $1,913 million
on 1998.  This  reduction  was a result of the Group's  decision to increase the
focus of its capital programme.

     Acquisitions and disposals of businesses produced a net cash inflow of $243
million  compared with $778 million in 1998. The major element of this reduction
in cash inflow was the  turnaround  of the funding of joint  ventures from a net
release of funds in 1998 of $708 million to a net requirement of $750 million in
1999.  This  increase  in cash  outflow was  partially  offset by an increase in
proceeds from the sale of businesses  which  amounted to $1,292  million in 1999
compared  with $780 million in 1998.  Also within this net  reduction  were cash
outflows for  acquisitions  and  investments  in associated  undertakings  which
amounted to $299 million, a decrease of $411 million over 1998.

     Dividend  payments  increased by $1,727  million to $4,135 million in 1999.
This  reflected  the  termination  of the former BP share  dividend plan and the
fifth dividend payment in 1999 due to the  harmonization and acceleration of the
payment timetable.

     Net cash outflow for 1998 was $906 million, compared with an inflow of $878
million in 1997. The change  reflected  lower operating cash flow resulting from
lower income and a smaller  reduction in working  capital  requirements  than in
1997,  partially  offset by a turnaround in the funding position of the BP/Mobil
joint venture, lower net capital expenditures and lower tax payments.

     Net cash inflow from operating activities fell from $15,558 million in 1997
to $9,586  million in 1998.  Most of this  decrease  was caused by the effect on
profits  of  the  deterioration  in the  operating  environment  for  all of our
businesses.  The requirement  for funding  working capital  decreased in 1998 by
$352 million, compared with a reduction of $1,779 million in 1997.

     Dividends from joint ventures and associated undertakings increased to $966
million  in 1998  from $741  million  in 1997,  mainly  as a result of  improved
profits from the BP/Mobil joint venture.  The net cash outflow from servicing of
finance and from  returns on  investments  increased  to $825  million from $655
million in 1997,  principally  because of the payment of  dividends  to minority
shareholders. Tax payments fell from $2,273 million in 1997 to $1,705 million in
1998.

     Payments  for capital  expenditures  on fixed assets and purchase of shares
for employee share schemes, net of proceeds from sales of fixed assets, amounted
to $7,298  million  in 1998.  This  represented  a small  decrease  over the net
payments of $7,432 million in 1997.

                                       61
<PAGE>
     Acquisitions  and disposals of businesses  resulted in a net cash inflow of
$778 million in 1998  compared with an outflow of $2,624  million in 1997.  This
was due in part to an increase  in  disposal  proceeds  but  principally  to the
funding  situation with joint ventures.  A turnaround in the funding position of
the BP/Mobil  joint  venture  produced net cash inflows of $708 million in 1998,
whereas in 1997 the  initial  funding of this and certain  other joint  ventures
caused an outflow of $1,967 million.

     Dividend  payments  decreased  by $29  million  to $2,408  million in 1998,
reflecting  an  increase  in  distributions  offset  by a higher  proportion  of
shareholders opting for the share dividend.

FINANCING THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES

     The Group's principal commodity, oil, is priced internationally in dollars.
Group  policy has been to minimize  economic  exposure to currency  movements by
financing  operations  with dollar debt  wherever  possible,  achieving  this by
currency swaps when funds have been raised in currencies other than dollars.

     The Group's finance debt is almost  entirely in US dollars.  Net debt, that
is debt less cash and liquid resources,  was $12,993 million at the end of 1999,
an increase  of $113  million  over the year.  The ratio of net debt to net debt
plus equity was 23%, the same as a year ago.

     At  December  31, 1999  contracts  had been  placed for  authorized  future
capital  expenditure   estimated  at  $2,544  million,   mainly  in  respect  of
exploration  and  production  activities.  Such  expenditure  is  expected to be
financed largely by cash flow from operating  activities.  At December 31, 1999,
the Group had available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of $3,000 million
($2,800 million at December 31, 1998).

     BP Amoco has in place a Debt Issuance Programme (the Programme).  Under the
Programme  certain  subsidiaries  of the Group may from time to time  issue debt
securities  guaranteed by the Company.  The debt may have a minimum  maturity of
one  month  and no  maximum  maturity.  Aggregate  debt  outstanding  under  the
Programme  will not at any time  exceed $4  billion or the  equivalent  in other
currencies.  At March 24, 2000, the amount drawn down against this Programme was
$2,705 million.

OUTLOOK

     Crude oil prices  continue to respond to OPEC's supply side management and,
though inventories have been substantially  reduced, the market remains orderly.
Continuing OPEC restraint,  together with firm underlying demand, is expected to
lead to  short-term  robustness  in the oil price,  though  volatility  is to be
expected, dependent on weather and market sentiment.

     Natural gas prices are expected to show normal seasonal variation.

     Downstream, the development of marketing margins is expected to depend upon
future  movements in crude oil and hence product  prices.  Refining  margins are
expected to remain volatile.

     In Chemicals,  margins are expected to respond to developments in feedstock
costs assuming firmness in demand.  Surplus industry capacity,  particularly new
capacity  coming on stream in the second half of 2000,  together with continuing
euro weakness, are expected to limit upside potential.

     The foregoing  discussion  focuses on certain trends and general market and
economic  conditions  and  outlook  on  production  levels or rates,  prices and
margins  and, as such,  are  forward-looking  statements  that  involve risk and
uncertainty   that  could  cause  actual  results  and  developments  to  differ
materially  from  those  expressed  or implied  by these  discussions.  By their
nature,  forward-looking  statements  involve risk and uncertainty  because they
relate to events and depend on  circumstances  that will occur in the future and
are outside the control of BP Amoco.  Actual results may differ  materially from
those expressed in such statements, depending on a variety of factors, including
the  specific   factors   identified  in  the  discussions   accompanying   such
forward-looking statements; future levels of industry product supply, demand and
pricing; political stability and economic growth in relevant areas of the world;
development and use of new technology and successful partnering;  the actions of
competitors,  natural  disasters and other changes to business  conditions;  and
other factors discussed elsewhere in this report. For a discussion of additional
factors  that may  affect the above  discussion,  see Item 1 --  Description  of
Business -- Additional Factors Which May Affect Business.

<PAGE>
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

     The Group's  policy is to  co-ordinate  certain key  activities on a global
basis in order to optimize its financial position and performance. These include
the management of the currency, maturity and interest rate profile of borrowing,
cash, other significant  financial risks and relationships  with banks and other
financial  institutions.  International oil trading and risk management relating
to the  businesses'  commercial  operations  are  carried out by the Group's oil
trading divisions.

     BP Amoco is exposed to financial risks,  including market risk, credit risk
and liquidity risk, arising from the Group's normal business  activities.  These
risks and the Group's approach to dealing with them are discussed below.

MARKET RISK

     Market risks  include the  possibility  that  changes in currency  exchange
rates,  interest rates or oil and gas prices will adversely  affect the value of
the Group's financial assets,  liabilities or expected future cash flows. Market
risks are managed using a range of financial and commodity instruments including
derivatives. We also trade derivatives in conjunction with these risk management
activities.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

     Fluctuations in exchange rates can have significant  effects on the Group's
operating  results.  The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are subsumed
within business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in
market  adjustment to movements in rates, and conversion  differences  accounted
for on specific transactions.  For this reason the total effect of exchange rate
fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the Group's reported results.

     The main underlying  economic  currency of the Group's cash flows is the US
dollar and the Group's  borrowings are predominantly in US dollars.  Our foreign
exchange  management policy is to minimize  economic and material  transactional
exposures from currency movements against the US dollar.

     The Group co-ordinates the handling of foreign exchange risks centrally, by
netting off naturally occurring opposite exposures wherever possible,  to reduce
the risk, and then dealing with any material  residual  foreign  exchange risks.
Significant   residual  non-dollar  exposures  are  managed  using  a  range  of
derivatives.  See Item 9A --  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  about
Market Risk.

INTEREST RATES

     The BP Amoco Group is exposed to interest rate risk on short- and long-term
floating  rate  instruments  and as a result of the  refinancing  of fixed  rate
finance  debt.  Consequently,  as well as managing  the currency and maturity of
debt,  the Group manages  interest costs through the balance  between  generally
lower-cost  floating rate debt, which has inherently  higher risk, and generally
more  expensive,  but  lower-risk,   fixed  rate  debt.  The  Group  is  exposed
predominantly  to US dollar LIBOR (London  Inter-Bank Offer Rate) interest rates
as borrowings are mainly denominated in, or are swapped into, US dollars.

     The BP Amoco Group uses  derivatives  to achieve the  required  mix between
fixed and floating rate debt. During 1999, debt policy was to keep floating rate
debt below an upper limit of 65% of total net debt.  Actual  floating  rate debt
for the year was in the range of 47-53%.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES

     BP Amoco's oil trading division uses financial and commodity derivatives as
part  of the  overall  optimization  of the  value  of the  Group's  equity  oil
production  and as part of the  associated  trading of crude oil,  products  and
related instruments.  The Group also uses financial and commodity derivatives to
manage  certain  of  its  exposures  to  price   fluctuations   on  natural  gas
transactions.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING

     In market risk management and trading, only  well-understood,  conventional
derivative  instruments  are used.  These include  futures and options traded on
regulated exchanges and `over-the-counter' swaps, options and forward contracts.

                                       63
<PAGE>
     Where  derivatives  constitute a hedge, the Group's exposure to market risk
created by the  derivative is offset by the opposite  exposure  arising from the
asset,  liability,  cash flow or transaction  being hedged.  By contrast,  where
derivatives are held for trading  purposes,  changes in market risk factors give
rise to realized and  unrealized  gains and losses,  which are recognized in the
current period.

     All  financial  instrument  and  derivative  activity,   whether  for  risk
management  or  trading,  is  carried  out by  specialist  teams  which have the
appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close
financial and management  control,  meeting generally accepted industry practice
and reflecting the  principles of the Group of Thirty Global  Derivatives  Study
recommendations.  An independent  control function  monitors  compliance with BP
Amoco's policies.

     The control framework includes  prescribed trading limits that are reviewed
regularly by senior  management,  daily  monitoring  of risk  exposure,  marking
trading  exposures to market and reviewing  open positions to assess the Group's
exposure in potentially adverse situations.

     Further  details  of BP  Amoco's  use of  derivatives  appear in Item 9A --
Quantitative  and Qualitative  disclosures  about Market Risk, and in Item 18 --
Note 28 of Notes to Financial Statements.

CREDIT RISK

     Credit risk is the potential  exposure of the Group to loss in the event of
non-performance  by a  counterparty.  The credit risk  arising  from the Group's
normal commercial  operations is controlled by individual operating units within
guidelines.  In  addition,  as a  result  of the use of  financial  instruments,
including  derivatives,  to manage market risk,  the Group has credit  exposures
through its dealings in the financial and specialized  oil and gas markets.  The
Group  controls the related  credit risk by entering  into  contracts  only with
highly  credit-rated  counterparties  and through credit  approvals,  limits and
monitoring  procedures,  and  does  not  usually  require  collateral  or  other
security.  Counterparty  credit  validation,  independent  of  the  dealers,  is
undertaken before contractual commitment. The Group has not experienced material
non-performance by any counterparty.

LIQUIDITY RISK

     Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the Group's
business  activities may not be available.  The Group has long-term debt ratings
of Aa1 and AA+ assigned  respectively  by Moody's and  Standard and Poor's.  The
Group has access to a wide range of funding at  competitive  rates  through  the
capital markets and banks. It co-ordinates  relationships with banks,  borrowing
requirements,  foreign exchange requirements and cash management centrally.  The
Group  believes  it has  access  to  sufficient  funding  and has  also  undrawn
committed  borrowing   facilities  to  meet  currently   foreseeable   borrowing
requirements.  At December  31,1999,  the Group had available  undrawn committed
facilities of $3 billion.  These committed  facilities,  which are mainly with a
number of  international  banks,  expire in 2000. The Group expects to renew the
facilities on an annual basis.

INSURANCE

     The Group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where
this is required  for legal or  contractual  reasons.  This is because  external
insurance is not  considered  economic for the Group.  Losses will  therefore be
borne as they arise rather than being spread over time through insurance premia.
The position is reviewed periodically.

MILLENNIUM IT RISK

     The Year 2000 issue,  which stems from computer  programs written using two
digits rather than four to define the  applicable  year,  could have resulted in
processing  faults  on  the  change  of  century,  producing  a  wide  range  of
consequences.

     To avoid any such consequences,  BP Amoco undertook a Group-wide risk-based
review of its computer  systems and process control  equipment and developed and
implemented plans to remediate potential Year 2000-related faults by replacement
or repair. The project was designed to minimize risks arising from the Year 2000
problem  which might  endanger  health,  safety,  the  environment,  the Group's
reputation or its cash flow.

                                       64
<PAGE>
     The Year 2000 programme covered IT application  systems and infrastructure,
process  control  systems and embedded  microprocessors  in plants,  oil and gas
fields and  building  facilities,  and an  assessment  of the  readiness  of our
critical suppliers,  customers, joint venturers and partners.  Contingency plans
were developed to manage any risk  associated with our operations or third party
dependencies.

     In the event,  the Group achieved a smooth and successful  transition  into
2000.  In  addition  to dealing  with the  specific  Year 2000  risk,  important
additional  benefits  were  seen  from the Year  2000  programme  in a number of
different areas across the Group.

     A critical point has been passed successfully, but the Group is maintaining
an  appropriate  level of  vigilance  to deal with any  consequential  Year 2000
effects, especially from third parties, which may yet emerge.

     The total cost of the Group's Year 2000  programme was $335 million,  which
includes some minor expenditure in the first few months of 2000. These costs are
charged against income in the period in which they are incurred.

THE EURO

     As a result of the Treaty establishing the European  Community,  as amended
by the Treaty on European Union,  (the Treaty),  European  economic and monetary
union (EMU) has occurred for eleven out of the fifteen  member  countries of the
European Union (participating countries). The final stage of the Treaty began on
January 1, 1999.

     For the participating  countries,  the fixed conversion rates between their
sovereign  currencies (legacy  currencies) prior to January 1, 1999 and the euro
have been established. The euro has been adopted as their common legal currency.
The legacy  currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as  denominations of
the euro between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002 (the transition period).

     The United Kingdom has not participated  initially in EMU, but may do so at
a later time.  The current  policy of the UK  government is that any decision to
join EMU will only be taken  after a national  referendum  of the people and, in
any event, not before 2002.

     BP Amoco's commercial and financial processes were successfully  adapted to
allow its European operations to undertake  transactions in the euro and capture
competitive  advantage  offered by the new  currency,  from January 1, 1999.  In
common with experience generally across Europe, the actual level of transactions
in euros for our  businesses  has until now been low. The currency of accounting
records and the related systems will be converted during the transition  period,
which ends on January 1, 2002.  The  capability to conduct  business in national
currencies will be retained as long as necessary.  The costs associated with the
euro programme are estimated at $100 million, of which some $26 million had been
incurred and expensed by the end of 1999.

     It is  difficult  to  predict  whether  the euro will  affect  the level or
volatility  of  foreign  exchange  rates.  However,  we do not  expect  that the
introduction  of the euro will have a significant  effect on the Group's results
of operations, its financial position or liquidity.

     Operating and capital expenditure on the prevention,  control, abatement or
elimination of air,  water and solid waste  pollution is often not incurred as a
separately  identifiable  transaction.  Instead,  it  forms  part  of  a  larger
transaction which includes,  for example,  normal maintenance  expenditure.  The
figures for  environmental  operating and capital  expenditure  in the table are
therefore  estimates,  based on the  definitions  and guidelines of the American
Petroleum Institute.

     In 1999, environmental operating expenditure and amounts spent on clean-ups
were slightly lower than 1998. The reduction in capital expenditure reflects the
completion of a number of capital projects at the end of 1998. Similar levels of
operating and capital  expenditure  are expected in the foreseeable  future.  In
addition to operating and capital  expenditure,  we create provisions for future
environmental  remediation.  Expenditure  against  such  provisions  is normally
incurred in subsequent  periods and is not included in  environmental  operating
expenditure reported for such periods.

     Provisions  for  environmental  remediation  are made  when a  clean-up  is
probable  and  the  amount  reasonably  determinable.  Generally,  their  timing
coincides  with  commitment  to a formal  plan of  action  or,  if  earlier,  on
divestment or on closure of inactive sites.  These provisions are usually set up
on a  discounted  basis,  as required by  Financial  Reporting  Standard  No.12,
`Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.

     The  extent  and  cost of  future  remediation  programmes  are  inherently
difficult to estimate.  They depend on the scale of any possible  contamination,
the timing and extent of corrective  actions,  and also the Group's share of the
liability. Although the cost of any future remediation could be significant, and
may be  material  to the  result  of  operations  in the  period  in which it is
recognized,  we do not expect that such costs will have a material effect on the
Group's  financial  position  or  liquidity.   We  believe  our  provisions  are
sufficient  for known  requirements,  and we do not believe  that our costs will
differ significantly from those of other companies engaged in similar industries
or that our competitive position will be adversely affected as a result.

     With  effect  from  January 1, 1999 BP Amoco  adopted  Financial  Reporting
Standard No. 12 which  requires that the Group now provide fully for the cost of
decommissioning  oil and gas production  facilities  and related  pipelines on a
discounted basis at the commencement of production.

     Further details of decommissioning  and environmental  provisions appear in
Item 18 --  Note  27 of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements.  See  also  Item 1 --

ITEM 9A -- QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     BP Amoco is exposed to a number of different  market risks arising from the
Group's normal business activities.  Market risk is the possibility that changes
in currency  exchange  rates,  interest rates or oil and natural gas prices will
adversely  affect the value of the  Group's  financial  assets,  liabilities  or
expected future cash flows.  The Group has developed  policies aimed at managing
the volatility  inherent in certain of these natural  business  exposures and in
accordance with these policies the Group enters into various  transactions using
derivative financial and commodity  instruments  (derivatives).  Derivatives are
contracts  whose  value  is  derived  from  one  or  more  underlying  financial
instruments,  indices or prices which are defined in the contract. We also trade
derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.

     In  market  risk   management   and  in  trading,   only   well-understood,
conventional  derivative instruments are used. These include futures and options
traded on regulated exchanges, and 'over-the-counter' swaps, options and forward
contracts.

     Where  derivatives  constitute a hedge, the Group's exposure to market risk
created by the  derivative is offset by the opposite  exposure  arising from the
asset, liability or transaction being hedged. By contrast, where derivatives are
held for trading purposes,  changes in market risk factors give rise to realized
and unrealized gains and losses, which are recognized in the current period.

     All material derivatives activity,  whether for risk management or trading,
is carried out by specialist teams which have appropriate skills, experience and
supervision.  These teams are subject to close financial and management control,
meeting  generally  accepted  industry practice and reflecting the principles of
the Group of Thirty Global  Derivatives  Study  recommendations.  An independent
control  function  monitors  compliance  with BP Amoco's  derivative  management
policies.  The control  framework  includes  prescribed  trading limits that are
reviewed  regularly by senior  management,  daily  monitoring of risk  exposure,
marking  trading  exposures to market and reviewing  open positions to assess BP
Amoco's  exposure  in  potentially  adverse   situations.   Counterparty  credit
validation,  independent  of  the  dealers,  is  undertaken  before  contractual
commitment.

     Further   information   about  BP  Amoco's   use  of   derivatives,   their
characteristics,  and the  accounting  treatment  thereof is given in Item 18 --
Note 1 and Note 28 of Notes to Financial Statements.

RISK MANAGEMENT

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

     Fluctuations in exchange rates can have  significant  effects on BP Amoco's
operating  results.  The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are subsumed
within business operating results through changing cost-competitiveness, lags in
market adjustment to movements in rates, and conversion differences accounted on
specific  transactions.  For this  reason,  the total  effect of  exchange  rate
fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the Group's reported results.

     The underlying economic currency of the Group's cash flows is mainly the US
dollar. This is because BP Amoco's major product, oil, is priced internationally
in US dollars.  BP Amoco's  foreign  exchange  management  policy is to minimize
economic and material  transactional  exposures from currency  movements against
the US dollar.  The Group  co-ordinates  the handling of foreign  exchange risks
centrally,  by netting  off  naturally  occurring  opposite  exposures  wherever
possible,  to reduce  the risk,  and then  dealing  with any  material  residual
foreign exchange risks.  Significant  residual non-dollar  exposures are managed
using a range of  derivatives.  The most  significant  of such exposures are the
sterling-based capital leases, that part of the quarterly dividend which is paid
in sterling, the sterling cash flow requirements for UK Corporation Tax, and the
capital expenditure and operational  requirements of Exploration,  mainly in the
UK. In addition,  most of the Group's  borrowings are in US dollars,  are hedged
with respect to the US dollar, or are swapped into dollars where this achieves a
lower cost of  financing.  At December  31,  1999 the total of foreign  currency
borrowings  not swapped into dollars  amounted to $275  million.  The  principal
element of this is $90 million of borrowings in Malaysian ringgits.

     The following tables provide information about the Group's foreign currency
derivative  financial  instruments.   These  include  foreign  currency  forward
exchange  agreements  (forwards) and cylinder option contracts  (cylinders) that
are sensitive to changes in the  sterling/dollar  exchange  rate.  Where foreign
currency  denominated  borrowings  are swapped  into dollars  using  forwards or
currency  interest rate swaps such that currency risk is completely  eliminated,
neither the borrowing nor the derivative are included in the table.

                                       67
<PAGE>
     For forwards,  the tables present the notional amounts and weighted average
contractual  exchange rates by contractual  maturity dates and exclude  forwards
that have offsetting positions.  Only significant forward positions are included
in the tables.  The notional  amounts of forwards are translated into US dollars
at the exchange rate included in the contract at inception.  The majority of the
sterling contracts consist of forwards relating to sterling-based capital leases
which effectively  convert the lease obligation from sterling into dollars.  The
remaining  contracts  relate  to  sterling   requirements  for  net  operational
expenditures.  The fair value  represents  an estimate of the gain or loss which
would be realized if the contracts were settled at the balance sheet date.

     For cylinders,  the tables present the notional  amounts of the constituent
purchased  call and written put option  contracts  at December  31, 1999 and the
weighted  average strike rates by contractual  maturity  dates.  At December 31,
1999,  the  sterling  cylinders  related to the Group's  expected  sterling  tax
payments over the next year. We no longer hedge the expected  sterling  dividend
over the next year using  cylinders but hedge each  quarter's  sterling  payment
using forwards which mature within the quarter.

     The fair values for the foreign  exchange  contracts in the table below are
based on market prices of comparable  instruments  (forwards) and pricing models
which  take into  account  relevant  market  data  (options).  These  derivative
contracts  constitute  a hedge;  any change in the fair value or  expected  cash
flows is offset by an opposite change in the market value or expected cash flows
of the asset, liability or transaction being hedged.

INTEREST RATE RISK

     BP  Amoco  is  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk on  short-  and  long-term
floating-rate  instruments  and as a result  of the  refinancing  of  fixed-rate
finance debt. Consequently, as well as managing the currency and the maturity of
debt, the Group manages  interest costs through the balance  between  lower-cost
floating  rate debt,  which has  inherently  higher  risk,  and  generally  more
expensive but lower-risk, fixed-rate debt. The Group is exposed predominantly to
US dollar LIBOR  interest  rates as  borrowings  are mainly  denominated  in, or
swapped into,  US dollars.  The BP Amoco Group uses  derivatives  to achieve the
required mix between fixed and floating rate debt.  During 1999, debt policy was
to keep floating rate debt below an upper limit of 65% of total net debt. Actual
floating rate debt for the year was in the range of 47-53%.

     The following  table shows, by major  currency,  the Group's  borrowings at
December  31, 1999 and the weighted  average  interest  rates  achieved at those
dates through a  combination  of borrowings  and other  interest rate  sensitive
instruments entered into to manage interest rate exposure.

</TABLE>

     The Group's  earnings are  sensitive to changes in interest  rates over the
forthcoming  year as a result of the floating rate  instruments  included in the
Group's finance debt at December 31, 1999.  These include the effect of interest
rate and currency swaps and forwards  utilized to manage  interest rate risk. If
the  interest  rates  applicable  to  floating  rate  instruments  were  to have
increased by 1% on January 1, 2000, the Group's 2000 earnings before taxes would
decrease by approximately  $80 million.  This assumes that the amount and mix of
fixed and floating rate debt,  including capital leases,  remains unchanged from
that in place at  December  31,  1999 and that the change in  interest  rates is
effective from the beginning of the year.  Where the interest rate applicable to
an  instrument  is reset  during a quarter it is assumed that this occurs at the
beginning  of the  quarter and remains  unchanged  for the rest of the year.  In
reality,  the fixed/floating  rate mix will fluctuate over the year and interest
rates will change continually.  Furthermore the effect on earnings shown by this
analysis  does not  consider  the effect of an  overall  reduction  in  economic
activity which could accompany such an increase in interest rates.

<PAGE>
OIL PRICE RISK

     The Group's  risk  management  policy with  respect to oil price risk is to
manage only those exposures associated with the immediate  operational programme
for certain of its equity  share of  production  and certain of its refinery and
marketing activities. To this end, BP Amoco's oil trading division uses the full
range of  conventional  oil  price-related  financial and commodity  derivatives
available in the oil markets.

     The  derivative  instruments  used for  hedging  purposes do not expose the
Group to market risk  because the change in their  market  value is offset by an
equal and  opposite  change  in the  market  value of the  asset,  liability  or
transaction being hedged.  The values at risk in respect of derivatives held for
oil price risk  management  purposes  are shown in isolation in the table below.
The items being hedged are not included in the values at risk.

     The value at risk model used is that discussed under Trading below,  except
that value at risk in respect  of oil price risk  management  does not take into
account physical crude oil or refined product  positions held by the Group. Thus
the  value  at risk  calculation  for oil  price  exposure  includes  derivative
financial  instruments  such  as  exchange-traded   futures  and  options,  swap
agreements and  over-the-counter  options and derivative  commodity  instruments
(commodity contracts that permit settlement either by delivery of the underlying
commodity or in cash) such as forward  contracts.  The values at risk  represent
the  potential  gain or loss in fair values  over a 24-hour  period with a 99.7%
confidence level.

     The  following  table  shows  values at risk for oil price risk  management
activities.

NATURAL GAS PRICE RISK

     BP Amoco's  general  policy  with  respect to natural  gas price risk is to
manage only a portion of its exposure to price fluctuations.  Natural gas swaps,
options and futures are used to convert  specific sales and purchases  contracts
from fixed  prices to market  prices.  Swaps are also used to hedge  exposure to
price  differentials  between  locations.  We also use derivatives to fix prices
which are favourable with respect to our forecasts of future prices.

     The table  below  provides  information  about the Group's  material  swaps
contracts that are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices.  Contract  amount
represents  the  notional  amount of the  contract.  Fair  value  represents  an
estimate  of the gain or loss which  would be  realized  if the  contracts  were
settled at the  balance  sheet  date.  Weighted  average  price  represents  the
year-end  forward  price for futures,  the fixed price and the year-end  forward
price related to the settlement month for swaps; and the weighted average strike
price for options.

     At December 31, 1999, in addition to the swaps contracts shown in the table
there were options  contracts with aggregate  notional amounts of $7 million and
terms of up to one year.

TRADING

     In conjunction  with the risk  management  activities  discussed  above, BP
Amoco also trades interest rate and foreign currency  exchange rate derivatives.
The Group  controls the scale of the trading  exposures by using a value at risk
model with a maximum value at risk limit authorized by the board.

     In  addition  to the risk  management  activities  related to equity  crude
disposal,  refinery  supply and  marketing,  BP  Amoco's  oil  trading  division
undertakes  trading in the full range of conventional  derivative  financial and
commodity  instruments and physical cargoes  available in the oil markets.  This
activity is monitored and measured  separately from the risk management activity
and is subject to maximum value at risk limits authorized by the board.

     The Group measures its market risk exposure, i.e. potential gain or loss in
fair  values,  on its trading  activity  using a value at risk  technique.  This
technique  is based  on a  variance/covariance  model  and  makes a  statistical
assessment  of the market risk arising from  possible  future  changes in market
values over a 24-hour period.  The calculation of the range of potential changes
in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures, and the
history of one day price  movements over the previous  twelve  months,  together
with the correlation of these price  movements.  The potential  movement in fair
values is expressed to three standard  deviations which is equivalent to a 99.7%
confidence  level.  This means that, in broad terms,  one would expect to see an
increase or a decrease in fair values greater than the value at risk on only one
occasion per year if the portfolio were left unchanged.

     The Group  calculates  value at risk on all  instruments  that are held for
trading  purposes and that  therefore give an exposure to market risk. The value
at risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments such as interest
rate forward and futures  contracts,  swap  agreements,  options and  swaptions;
foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options; and
oil price futures, swap agreements and options. Financial assets and liabilities
and  physical  crude  oil and  refined  products  that are  treated  as  trading
positions are also included in these calculations. The value at risk calculation
for oil price exposure also includes derivative commodity instruments (commodity
contracts that permit settlement either by delivery of the underlying  commodity
or in cash), such as forward contracts.

ITEM 11 -- COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

INTRODUCTION

     During  the 12 months  following  the  merger  between  BP and  Amoco,  the
Remuneration   Committee  of  the  board  (the   Committee)   has  undertaken  a
comprehensive  review  of the way in which it  determines  the  remuneration  of
executive  directors and of the  effectiveness  of its policies for the needs of
the merged company.  BP Amoco competes  globally for business and for customers,
with each business  stream of the Company now exceeding  most FTSE  companies in
size.  It also  competes  globally  for talent,  with fewer than half of its top
management team being of British nationality.

     In  its  review  the  Committee  was  assisted  by a  team  of  independent
consultants  in a study  of  other  global-scale  companies,  with a  particular
emphasis on those based in Europe.  Having taken  account of that study,  and of
the  development of the Company,  the Committee has concluded that an individual
director's  home  nationality  should be regarded as of secondary  importance in
setting  remuneration.  Therefore,  in order to ensure  greater  equity at board
level,  all executive  directors will now have their potential  remuneration set
against global competitive  comparisons,  irrespective of their own nationality.
The  remuneration of BP Amoco's  directors will continue to be compared with the
remuneration  of directors in their own countries  (in companies of  appropriate
scale and global  spread) to ensure that  remuneration  policies  and  practices
remain competitive in the home market. Further rigorous comparisons will then be
made against an international set of appropriate companies.

     The Committee has also decided that the remuneration of executive directors
should in future be managed  separately  from that of other  senior  executives.
Shareholders'  agreement  will  be  sought  for  the  creation  of an  Executive
Directors'  Incentive  Plan  for  their  remuneration.  Directors  will  then be
excluded from future  participation  in any other incentive plans. The following
information relates  specifically to the reward of executive  directors,  unless
stated otherwise.

                                       75
<PAGE>
CHANGES MADE DURING 1999

     There have been two  immediate  outcomes  of the  changes to the  Company's
reward  philosophy  for  executive  directors.  The  first  has  been  a set  of
adjustments  to base  salaries  during  1999,  which have also  affected  annual
incentive bonuses for the year. Secondly, long-term incentive grants in the 1997
and 1998 Long Term  Performance  Plans  (LTPPs) have been  adjusted to provide a
means of reducing the  imbalance in rewards  between  former BP and former Amoco
directors  following the merger.  These  potential  long-term plan awards are in
line with plans approved by shareholders in late 1998.

PROPOSED CHANGES IN 2000

     The major change  proposed for 2000 is the  introduction  of the  Executive
Directors'  Incentive  Plan which will provide for the  granting of  performance
shares,  share options and cash incentives at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee.

     The Committee  proposes to introduce two component plans under the umbrella
of the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan - a long-term  performance plan and a
stock  option  plan.  The first plan will  mirror the  existing  plan for senior
executives in the Company while the option plan will be structured to extend the
timescale of the  performance-reward  linkage. The proposed target structure for
the two component plans is set out under  `Performance  measures and targets for
2000',  which shows the updated  competitor  set for the long-term plan measure,
and gives outline  details of the annual  incentive plan targets for 2000 and of
the performance  condition that is under consideration for the granting of share
options.

     No changes  are  proposed  in the way the Long Term  Performance  Plan will
operate for executive directors.  The rules of the current Plan were approved by
shareholders  in November 1998.  Future grants to directors  under the Executive
Directors'  Incentive  Plan will be managed  in the same way and  subject to the
same targets and  conditions,  including the plan design  feature which requires
directors to build up a personal  shareholding  in the Company equal in value to
at least five times their annual salary.

     In 1998, when shareholders approved the current BP Amoco Share Option Plan,
it was  considered  appropriate  to maintain  the  competitive  focus on the oil
sector, and it was therefore  unnecessary to grant share options to UK directors
who participated in the Long Term  Performance  Plan. Share options were granted
in addition to LTPP only to North American  directors,  as is normal practice in
North America. A number of factors have now changed.

     First, to meet the board's new emphasis on setting the potential rewards of
all executive  directors at a more  equitable  level of global  competitiveness,
there is a consequent need to increase the scale of long-term  incentive  grants
for some directors. In coming to the conclusion that this could be best achieved
through use of share options,  in addition to the LTPP grants,  the emphasis has
been on how best to drive performance forward in the coming years. The LTPP will
still  predominate  as the Company's  long-term  incentive  vehicle,  and it has
already  helped BP Amoco to achieve the aims of maximizing  performance  through
all cycles in the oil sector.

     In addition to maintaining  that  performance,  it was felt  appropriate to
incorporate a new level of `stretch' into long-term  incentives  through the use
of a new and very challenging  performance measure, the FTSE Global 100 group of
companies.  This  wider  competitor  set gives BP  Amoco's  executive  directors
greater  exposure to  competition  with non-oil sector  performance,  as well as
creating better alignment with shareholders by giving increased  exposure to the
absolute  performance of the equity market itself.  (The LTPP measures  relative
performance.)

     Taking  all this  into  account,  the  board  favours  a policy of making a
balance  of grants  under both the  three-year  LTPP and the  longer-term  share
option plan, i.e.  following the approach which is currently taken in respect of
our US executive directors.

     The  remuneration  policy for the most senior  executives below board level
will be aligned with the policy for executive directors,  albeit with a stronger
focus on national market comparisons.  In particular,  share option grants under
the  1998  Plan  may  be  made  to  senior   executives  in  addition  to  their
participation  in the  Long  Term  Performance  Plan and  irrespective  of their
nationality.

REWARD PHILOSOPHY

     The  remuneration  of executive  directors in BP Amoco will be based on the
following guiding principles:

  -- total  potential  rewards  will  be  set at  levels  sufficient  to  retain
     high-calibre and high-potential staff who will have alternative  employment
     opportunities within a global market.

  -- total  potential  rewards  will be earned by the  achievement  of demanding
     performance targets based on measures which represent the best interests of
     the shareholders in the short, medium and long term.

  -- incentive plans,  performance targets and participating  conditions will be
     structured  to ensure that  directors  will be fully  aligned with the best
     interests of the Company at all stages of the business cycle.

  -- levels of reward for meeting  business  targets  will be fully  competitive
     within the appropriate  market while outstanding  rewards will be given for
     delivering world-class results.

  -- remuneration  policies  and  incentive  plans will be  designed to meet the
     highest standards of international industry.

REWARD PROCESS -- THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

     The  Remuneration  Committee's role is to determine the terms of engagement
and remuneration of the group chief executive and the executive  directors.  The
Remuneration  Committee (the Committee) also  establishes the principles for the
remuneration of other senior executives, which in turn provide the framework for
remunerating  all  employees.  At the beginning of the year the  Committee  sets
challenging and demanding performance targets for the executive directors and at
the end of the year makes awards which reflect the year's performance.

     The Committee members have no personal  financial  interest,  other than as
shareholders,  in the matters to be decided. They have no conflicts arising from
cross-directorships   or  day-to-day   involvement  in  running  BP  Amoco.  For
membership of the Committee see Item 10 -- Directors and Officers of Registrant.

     The  Committee  actively  solicits  professional  advice  from  independent
outside consultants.

     The  constitution and operation of the Committee are in compliance with the
`Principles of Good  Governance and Code of Best Practice' set out by the London
Stock  Exchange (the  `Combined  Code').  Ernst & Young have  confirmed that the
scope of their report on the accounts covers the  disclosures  contained in this
report that are specified for audit by the London Stock Exchange

DESCRIPTION OF THE REWARD PLANS

BASE SALARY

  -- This is a fixed sum,  payable  monthly  in  pensionable  cash,  recognizing
     ongoing market worth.

  -- Salaries are reviewed annually in line with global companies,  and targeted
     at the median of the appropriate national survey groups for fully effective
     job performance. Higher salaries are paid only where justified by sustained
     higher level of individual contribution.

  -- Surveys  are  conducted  on  a  regular  basis  by a  leading  remuneration
     consultancy  and look at  remuneration  levels in an  international  mix of
     companies with comparable size, complexity and global spread of operations.

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE BONUS

  -- This is a variable sum,  potentially  awarded  annually in  non-pensionable
     cash.    (Bonuses   to   North   American   executives   are   pensionable/
     benefits-bearing).

  -- It  recognizes  performance  against  demanding  annual  targets set out in
     annual performance contracts.

  -- Target bonus level for  executive  directors is 70% of base salary in 2000.
     If contract  levels of performance are achieved so that the target bonus is
     earned, executive annual remuneration levels reach a median position of the
     relevant global employment market.

  -- A  `stretch'   bonus  level  is  also   identified  for  when  targets  are
     substantially exceeded. (For directors, this is 105% of salary in 1999.)

  -- Outstanding  performance  may be recognized by bonus  payments in excess of
     the stretch level at the discretion of the Committee.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE

  -- The Long Term Performance Plan consists of rolling,  three-year performance
     periods,  at the  beginning  of  which  participants  receive  a  grant  of
     performance units.

  -- Any potential LTPP award is a variable, taxable sum, in shares, given after
     the  performance  period.  (Depending on the technical  constraints in each
     country in which the Plan is operated,  the  Committee  may award shares to
     participants or fund the purchase of shares by participants.)

  -- Share awards have a minimum of a further  three  years'  retention in trust
     and no shares will be released until the director has a personal holding in
     BP Amoco shares, within the Plans, equivalent to five times base salary.

SHARE OPTIONS

  -- Share options may be granted in proportion to the ranking of the Company by
     total  shareholder  return over a  three-year  period  relative to the FTSE
     Global 100 set of  companies.  Options  will vest three  years  after grant
     without further performance conditions.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGETS FOR 2000

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE BONUS

  -- Bonus targets focus on internal  operating plans and are a mix of financial
     targets and leadership  objectives.  The financial  targets  concentrate on
     savings in cash costs and bonus underlying performance improvement relative
     to competitors  and market  expectations,  while the leadership  objectives
     include safety, environment, people, organization and investment issues.

  -- These targets are embedded within  performance  contracts which reflect the
     operating plans of the Company, and are subject to board decision.

                                       78
<PAGE>
  -- Each year's performance  provides the platform for the next year's targets,
     providing a continuous drive to higher levels of achievement.

LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN (LTPP)

  -- The  LTPP  focuses  on  performance  within  the oil  sector  and  looks at
     performance against demanding three-year shareholder return,  profitability
     and growth targets.

  -- For all three  measures BP Amoco's  performance  is assessed in relation to
     the oil majors:  Chevron,  ENI, ExxonMobil,  Repsol YPF, Royal Dutch Shell,
     Texaco and TotalFina.

  -- The maximum award can be made only when  performance  has been ahead of the
     competitor group on all three  performance  measures.  For second and lower
     rankings  progressively  lower awards are made.  Participants  benefit only
     when they deliver results above the median for this group.

SHARE OPTIONS

  -- Option  grants  will be  related  to  performance  comparisons  with a wide
     selection of global  companies.  The Remuneration  Committee will take into
     account the ranking of the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) against
     the TSR of the FTSE  Global  100  group of  companies  over the  three-year
     period preceding the date of grant in setting the scale of grants.

 -- Options  granted to former Amoco  employees  during  1999-2000  will not be
     subject to any additional performance conditions, in line with the practice
     followed  previously  in Amoco.  (Under the terms of the merger  agreement,
     options  granted to former  Amoco Group  employees  must,  for at least two
     years, be no less favourable than their previous arrangements.)

REPORT ON 1999 -- REMUNERATION DATA FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

BASE SALARY AWARDS IN 1999

     Base salaries for executive directors were adjusted in two steps during the
year by a total  average  increase  of 22% to reflect  the  increased  scale and
complexity of directors' responsibilities.

                                       79
<PAGE>
BONUS AWARDS FOR 1999 PERFORMANCE

     The Committee  established a bonus rating of 148% based on the  achievement
of targets set for 1999. This rating took into account,  among other things, the
operating performance of the Company which reflected the substantial benefits of
restructuring and integration  following the merger,  together with ongoing cost
control;  the  saving  of  cash  costs  and  the  substantial   contribution  of
performance  improvements  to the  results  for the year;  the return on average
capital  employed  and  earnings  per  share,  which  were both  strong and very
competitive in the sector; and the progress made against non-financial  targets.
Bonus awards for executive directors were therefore significantly higher than in
1998. Annual remuneration for 1999 is shown in the table below.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS
BP AMOCO LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

     Awards made in 1999 under the BP Long Term  Performance Plan related to the
1996-98 Plan. Estimates of grant values were indicated in BP Amoco's 1998 Annual
Report on Form 20-F.

     Awards to be made in 2000 under the BP Long Term Performance Plan relate to
the 1997-99 Plan.

     BP Amoco came first in the 1997-99  Plan,  and the  Remuneration  Committee
expects to make a maximum award.  The primary  performance  measure,  BP Amoco's
shareholder  return against the market  (SHRAM),  was 15%. BP Amoco was the only
company in the peer group to exceed market returns during the three-year period,
and was more than 20% ahead of the nearest-ranked competitor.

     At the time of the merger the Committee decided to set minimum award levels
for all  participants in the 1998 Plans,  including  executive  directors.  This
decision was based on pre-merger  announcement  comparisons of total shareholder
returns, and provides an indication for participants that the final outcome will
be no less  than the  SHRAM  performance  measure  position  which  BP held,  in
relation  to its  peer  group  comparators,  before  the  merger.  As  mentioned
previously,  some executive  directors have also had  additional  grants,  under
these plans, to bring them closer to a common global standard.

     The total number of shares that may be awarded to all  directors  under the
1997-99 Plan is 2,190,600,  with a value of $16.8 million based on a share price
of L4.81/$7.65 at L1 = $1.59 (mid-market price on February 14, 2000).

     Serving  recipients  in the LTPP are  obliged to have the  balance of their
1997-99  awards  retained  in trust for at least a  further  three  years.  This
restriction  also  applies  to future  Plans,  together  with  additional  share
ownership requirements.

     Potential awards to executive  directors,  including an indicative range of
potential  awards  under  the 1998 and 1999  Plans,  for which  awards  would be
payable in 2001 and 2002, are set out in the table below.

SHARE SCHEMES AND OTHER BENEFITS

     In 1999, six UK directors were allocated  shares under the BP Participating
Share Scheme which is available to most UK  employees.  Under the  Participating
Scheme,  the Company matches employees' own contribution of shares, all of which
are held for a  defined  period  (see  Item 18 -- Note 33 of Notes to  Financial
Statements). Six directors continued to participate in the Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme,  under which  employees  enter a savings plan to purchase  shares
after  three or five  years.  This  plan is also open to most UK  employees.  UK
directors  may  also  receive   modest   benefits   from  typical   all-employee
arrangements, such as a fuel discount card and free accidental death insurance.

<PAGE>
     Mr Fuller and Mr Lowrie were eligible to participate in those benefit plans
generally  provided  to  US  employees,   including  an  employee  savings  plan
containing a company matching  contribution of up to 7% of annual earnings,  and
certain  health and  welfare  plans,  including  medical  and  dental  coverage,
non-contributory  group life insurance of one times annual earnings,  additional
employee  paid group life  insurance,  and short-  and  long-term  sickness  and
disability  coverage.  In 1999,  the Company  contributed  $112,787  and $42,430
respectively to the Savings Plan to `match' their savings.

PENSIONS

UK DIRECTORS

     Pension and other  benefits have regard to competitor  practice in the home
country of each senior executive.

     In the UK,  eligible  staff can join the BP Pension  Scheme,  which  offers
Inland Revenue-approved retirement benefits, based on final salary.

     Scheme  members'  core  benefits,  which are  non-contributory,  comprise a
pension  accrual  rate of 1/60th of final basic salary for each year of service,
inclusive  of a  proportion  of  the  basic  state  pension,  up to a  limit  of
two-thirds of final basic salary; a lump-sum  death-in-service  benefit of three
times salary;  and a dependant's  benefit of two-thirds of actual or prospective
pension.  The link between the Scheme  pension and the basic state  pension will
cease for all members on May 1, 2000.

     Normal retirement age is 60, but members who have 30 or more years' service
at the age of 55 can opt to retire early without an actuarial reduction to their
pension.

     Post-retirement   pensions  are  reviewed   annually,   and  increases  are
guaranteed equivalent to the Retail Price Index (up to 5%).

     Directors who are members of the BP Pension  Scheme  accrue  pension at the
enhanced rate of 2/60ths of their final basic salary for each year of service as
managing  directors (up to the same  two-thirds  limit).  No  contributions  are
payable by executive directors.

     None of the directors is affected by the `pensionable earnings cap'.

     The BP Pension Scheme is the principal  section of the BP Pension Fund, the
latter being established under a trust deed.  Contributions to the Fund are made
on  the  advice  of  the  actuary  appointed  by  the  Trustee   directors.   No
contributions  were  made to the  Fund by the  Company  in  1999 in  respect  of
pensions accruing under the BP Pension Scheme.

US DIRECTORS

     All current US directors  participate in the Employee  Retirement  Plan for
Amoco  Corporation.  Under this retirement plan, the amount of the annuity which
they are  eligible  to receive on a  single-life  basis is  determined  under an
annuity benefit formula.

     The annuity benefit  formula  (including a percentage of US Social Security
benefits) is  calculated  at 1.67% x the  employee's  years of  participation  x
average  annual  earnings.  Such  earnings for Plan  purposes are  determined by
taking  separately the three highest  consecutive  calendar years' earnings from
salary and the three highest consecutive calendar years' bonus awards during the
10 years preceding retirement. The maximum annuity is 60% of such average annual
earnings.  Years of  participation  in the Plan in excess of 36 do not result in
additional benefits.

     Normal  pensionable  age in the  US  Plan  is  65.  There  is no  actuarial
reduction  to the pension  which  becomes  payable  between age 60 and 65, but a
reduction of 5% a year is applied if paid between age 50 and 59.

     In line with US tax  regulations,  benefits  are  provided  as  appropriate
through a combination of tax qualified and restoration/non-qualified plans.

SERVICE CONTRACTS

     All UK executive  directors appointed since 1996 hold a contract of service
which  includes a one-year  period of notice.  Sir John Browne and Mr Chase were
appointed before 1996 and have contracts which include a two-year notice period.
The Board does not consider it in  shareholders'  interest to renegotiate  these
contracts.  Mr Sanderson's contract is due to expire in 2000 when he reaches the
age of 60. Under each contract, the Company reserves the right to make a payment
in lieu of notice.

     Dr Stomberg was a director of BP prior to his retirement at the end of 1997
and served as a special adviser to the group chief executive on European matters
at a fixed annual salary of DM1.1 million until the end of 1999.

     Mr Fuller's and Mr Lowrie's  secondments  to BP Amoco began on December 31,
1998. Their underlying US employment agreements with BP Amoco Corporation have a
three-year  period.  Mr Fuller is due to retire in March  2000.  Mr  Lowrie's UK
secondment was subject to termination by mutual agreement,  after which he would
return to the USA and be subject to the terms of that US  employment  agreement.
His  secondment  terminated  on Apri1  1,1999,  and he  received  a  payment  of
$6,126,414 in line with the terms of his US agreement.

     On  his  appointment  as  an  executive  director,  Mr  Ford's  contractual
arrangements  were adjusted to provide for  termination on one year's notice and
retirement at 60. Mr Ford's salary in this post is $620,000.  If his contract is
terminated  by  the  Company   without  cause,  Mr  Ford  will  be  entitled  to
compensation  of $1  million a year (pro  rated  for part  years)  for each year
remaining  between  the  date of  severance  and the  date he  turns  60.  As an
expatriate,  Mr Ford receives a resettlement  allowance of $450,000 a year which
terminates on December 31, 2002.

REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

     The  Articles  of  Association   provide  that  the  remuneration  paid  to
non-executive  directors  shall be determined by the board within the limits set
by the shareholders.  Non-executive directors do not have service contracts with
the Company.

     During 1999 the  non-executive  co-chairman  of BP Amoco  received a fee of
$259,000 (L160,000).  The non-executive directors of BP Amoco received an annual
fee of $65,000  (L40,000) plus an allowance of $4,860  (L3,000) for occasions on
which a director  travels  across the Atlantic for a board  meeting or committee
meeting.  During  1999 the board met 11 times,  eight  times in the UK and three
times in the USA. Committee meetings are held in conjunction with board meetings
whenever feasible. Details of individual fees are set out below.

                        BP AMOCO p.l.c. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To:   The Board of Directors
      BP Amoco p.l.c.

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of BP Amoco
p.l.c. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements
of income,  changes in BP Amoco shareholders'  interest,  total recognized gains
and  losses,  and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended
December 31, 1999.  Our audits also  included the financial  statement  schedule
listed in the Index at Item 19(a).  These financial  statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

     The  consolidated  financial  statements  for each of the two  years in the
period  ended  December  31,1998  give  retroactive  effect to the merger of The
British Petroleum Company p.l.c. and Amoco Corporation, which has been accounted
for as a merger. We did not audit the financial  statements of Amoco Corporation
for the year  ended  December  31,1997,  which  statements  reflect  net  income
constituting  approximately 33% of the related consolidated  financial statement
total for the year  ended  December  31,  1997.  Those  statements,  which  were
prepared in accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States, were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to
us,  and our  opinion,  insofar as it  relates  to  amounts  included  for Amoco
Corporation for 1997 (before the conversion to accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the  United  Kingdom),  is based  solely on the report of the other
auditors.

     We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  United  Kingdom  auditing
standards  which do not differ in any  significant  respect  from United  States
generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation  (including  the  conversion of the financial
statements of Amoco Corporation to accounting  principles  generally accepted in
the United  Kingdom).  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

     In our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of other auditors,  the
consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of BP Amoco p.l.c. at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the  consolidated  results of its operations and
its  consolidated  cash flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United  Kingdom which differ in certain  respects from those  followed in
the United States (see Note 44 of Notes to Financial  Statements).  Also, in our
opinion,  the related financial statement schedule,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  presents  fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

To: THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
Shareholders of Amoco Corporation

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  statements of income and cash flows (not
presented  separately  herein)  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects the
results  of the  operations  and the cash  flows of  Amoco  Corporation  and its
subsidiaries  for the year ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted   accounting   principles.   These   financial   statements   are   the
responsibility  of Amoco  Corporation's  management;  our  responsibility  is to
express  an  opinion  on these  financial  statements  based on our  audit.  We
conducted our audit of these  statements in accordance with generally  accepted
auditing  standards  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

     87,179,495)  were issued  under the share  dividend  plan at par value,  by
     capitalization of paid in surplus.

(b)  Voting on substantive resolutions tabled at a general meeting is on a poll.
     On a poll,  shareholders  present  in person or by proxy have two votes for
     every L5 in nominal amount of the first and second  preference shares
     held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show of hands vote on
     other resolutions  (procedural matters) at a general meeting,  shareholders
     present in person or by proxy have one vote each.

     In the event of the winding up of the company preference shareholders would
     be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference  shares
     plus an amount in  respect of accrued  and unpaid  dividends  and a premium
     equal to the  higher of (i) 10% of the  capital  paid up on the  preference
     shares and (ii) the excess of the  average  market  price of such shares on
     the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     These  accounts are prepared in  accordance  with  applicable UK accounting
standards. The Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard No.12 `Provisions,
Contingent  Liabilities and Contingent  Assets' (FRS12) and Financial  Reporting
Standard  No.13  `Derivatives  and  Other  Financial  Instruments:  Disclosures'
(FRS13) with effect from January 1,1999.

     The  financial  information  for 1998 and 1997 has been  restated to comply
with the requirements of FRS12. See Note 43 for further information.

BASIS OF PREPARATION

     The Group's main activities are the exploration and production of crude oil
and natural gas; the refining, marketing, supply and transportation of petroleum
products; and the manufacturing and marketing of petrochemicals.

     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with UK generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires that  management  make  estimates and
assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues
and expenses;  and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities.  Actual
results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

GROUP CONSOLIDATION

     The Group financial  statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of
the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings  (subsidiaries).  The results
of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the
date on which control passes.

     An associated undertaking (associate) is an entity in which the Group has a
long-term equity interest and over which it exercises significant influence. The
consolidated  financial statements include the Group proportion of the operating
profit or loss,  exceptional  items,  stock  holding  gains or losses,  interest
expense, taxation and net assets of associates (the equity method).

     A joint  venture is an entity in which the Group has a  long-term  interest
and shares control with one or more  co-venturers.  The  consolidated  financial
statements  include the Group proportion of turnover,  operating profit or loss,
exceptional  items, stock holding gains or losses,  interest expense,  taxation,
gross  assets and gross  liabilities  of the joint  venture  (the  gross  equity
method).

     Certain of the Group's  activities are conducted through joint arrangements
and are included in the consolidated  financial  statements in proportion to the
Group's interest in the income, expenses,  assets and liabilities of these joint
arrangements.

     On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture or
associated  undertaking,  fair  values  reflecting  conditions  at the  date  of
acquisition are attributed to the  identifiable  net assets  acquired.  When the
cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the Group's share of
such net  assets  the  difference  is treated  as  purchased  goodwill.  This is
capitalized and amortized over its estimated useful economic life,  limited to a
maximum period of 20 years.

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

ACCOUNTING CONVENTION

     The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention.  Historical
cost  accounts  show the  profits  available  to  shareholders  and are the most
appropriate basis for presentation of the Group's balance sheet.  Profit or loss
determined under the historical cost convention  includes stock holding gains or
losses and, as a consequence,  does not necessarily  reflect  underlying trading
results.

REPLACEMENT COST

     The results of individual  businesses and geographical  areas are presented
on a replacement cost basis.  Replacement  cost operating  results exclude stock
holding gains or losses and reflect the average cost of supplies incurred during
the year,  and thus  provide  insight into  underlying  trading  results.  Stock
holding gains or losses represent the difference between the replacement cost of
sales and the historical cost of sales calculated  using the first-in  first-out
method.

     Inventories  are valued at cost to the Group using the  first-in  first-out
method or at net realizable value,  whichever is the lower. Stores are stated at
or below cost calculated mainly using the average method.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

     On  consolidation,  assets and liabilities of subsidiary  undertakings  are
translated  into US dollars at closing  rates of exchange.  Income and cash flow
statements  are  translated at average rates of exchange.  Exchange  differences
resulting from the retranslation of net investments in subsidiary and associated
undertakings  at  closing  rates,   together  with  differences  between  income
statements  translated at average rates and at closing rates,  are dealt with in
reserves.  Exchange  gains and losses  arising  on  long-term  foreign  currency
borrowings  used to finance the Group's  foreign  currency  investments are also
dealt with in reserves.  All other  exchange  gains or losses on  settlement  or
translation at closing rates of exchange of monetary  assets and liabilities are
included in the determination of profit for the year.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Group uses derivative  financial  instruments  (derivatives)  to manage
certain  exposures  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates and
interest  rates,  and to manage some of its margin  exposure from changes in oil
and natural gas prices.  Derivatives  are also traded in conjunction  with these
risk management activities.

     The  purpose  for which a  derivative  contract  is used is  identified  at
inception. To qualify as a derivative for risk management,  the contract must be
in accordance with  established  guidelines which ensure that it is effective in
achieving its objective.  All contracts not identified at inception as being for
the  purpose  of risk  management  are  designated  as being  held  for  trading
purposes,  as are all oil price  derivatives,  and  accounted for using the fair
value method.

     The Group accounts for derivatives using the following methods:

     FAIR VALUE  METHOD:  derivatives  are carried on the balance  sheet at fair
value (`marked to market') with changes in that value  recognized in earnings of
the period.  This method is used for all derivatives  which are held for trading
purposes.  Interest rate contracts traded by the Group include  futures,  swaps,
options and swaptions.  Foreign  exchange  contracts traded include forwards and
options. Oil price contracts traded include swaps, options and futures.

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

     ACCRUAL METHOD: amounts payable or receivable in respect of derivatives are
recognized ratably in earnings over the period of the contracts.  This method is
used for derivatives  held to manage  interest rate risk.  These are principally
swap agreements  used to manage the balance between fixed and floating  interest
rates on long-term  finance debt.  Other  derivatives  held for this purpose may
include  swaptions  and futures  contracts.  Amounts  payable or  receivable  in
respect of these  derivatives are recognized as adjustments to interest  expense
over the period of the contracts. Changes in the derivative's fair value are not
recognized.

     DEFERRAL  METHOD:  gains and  losses  from  derivatives  are  deferred  and
recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying  amounts,  as  appropriate,
when the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction  occurs.  This method
is used  for  derivatives  used to  convert  non-US  dollar  borrowings  into US
dollars,  to hedge  significant  non-US dollar firm  commitments  or anticipated
transactions,  and to manage some of the  Group's  exposure to natural gas price
fluctuations.  Derivatives  used to convert  non-US  dollar  borrowings  into US
dollars include foreign  currency swap agreements and forward  contracts.  Gains
and losses on these  derivatives  are deferred and recognized on maturity of the
underlying  debt,  together  with  the  matching  loss  or  gain  on  the  debt.
Derivatives used to hedge significant non-US dollar transactions include foreign
currency forward  contracts and options and to hedge natural gas price exposures
include  swaps,  futures and options.  Gains and losses on these  contracts  and
option premia paid are also deferred and  recognized in the income  statement or
as adjustments to carrying amounts, as appropriate,  when the hedged transaction
occurs.

     Where  derivatives  used to manage  interest rate risk or to convert non-US
dollar debt or to hedge other  anticipated cash flows are terminated  before the
underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction  occurs, the resulting gain or
loss is recognized on a basis which matches the timing and accounting  treatment
of the underlying debt or hedged transaction. When an anticipated transaction is
no longer likely to occur or finance debt is  terminated  before  maturity,  any
deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related derivative is recognized in
the income statement together with any gain or loss on the terminated item.

DEPRECIATION

     Oil and gas production  assets are depreciated  using a  unit-of-production
method based upon  estimated  proved  reserves.  Other  tangible and  intangible
assets are depreciated on the straight line method over their  estimated  useful
lives. The average estimated useful lives of refineries are 20 years,  chemicals
manufacturing  plants 20 years and service stations 15 years.  Other intangibles
are amortized over a maximum period of 20 years.

     The Group  undertakes a review for  impairment of a fixed asset or goodwill
if events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of the
fixed asset or goodwill may not be recoverable.  To the extent that the carrying
amount  exceeds the  recoverable  amount,  that is the higher of net  realizable
value and value in use,  the fixed  asset or  goodwill  is  written  down to its
recoverable  amount.  The value in use is determined  from estimated  discounted
future net cash flows.

MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURE

     Expenditure on major maintenance, refits or repairs is capitalized where it
enhances the performance of an asset above its originally  assessed  standard of
performance;  replaces  an  asset  or  part of an  asset  which  was  separately
depreciated and which is then written off; or restores the economic  benefits of
an asset which has been fully depreciated.  All other maintenance expenditure is
charged to income as incurred.

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE

     Exploration  expenditure is accounted for in accordance with the successful
efforts  method.  Exploration  and appraisal  drilling  expenditure is initially
capitalized  as an  intangible  fixed  asset.  When  proved  reserves of oil and
natural  gas  are  determined  and  development  is  sanctioned,   the  relevant
expenditure  is  transferred  to tangible  production  assets.  All  exploration
expenditure  determined as unsuccessful  is charged against income.  Exploration
licence   acquisition   costs  are  amortized  over  the  estimated   period  of
exploration.  Geological and geophysical  exploration  costs are charged against
income as incurred.

DECOMMISSIONING

     Provision for  decommissioning is recognized in full at the commencement of
oil and natural gas  production.  The amount  recognized is the present value of
the estimated future expenditure  determined in accordance with local conditions
and requirements.  A corresponding  tangible fixed asset of an amount equivalent
to the provision is also created.  This is  subsequently  depreciated as part of
the capital costs of the production and transportation facilities. Any change in
the present value of the estimated  expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to
the provision and the fixed asset.

PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX

     The   charge   for   petroleum   revenue   tax  is   calculated   using   a
unit-of-production method.

CHANGES IN UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION FACTORS

     Changes in factors which affect  unit-of-production  calculations are dealt
with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of prior years' amounts.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

     Environmental  expenditures  that relate to current or future  revenues are
expensed or capitalized as appropriate.  Expenditures that relate to an existing
condition  caused by past  operations  and that do not  contribute to current or
future earnings are expensed.

     Liabilities  for  environmental  costs are  recognized  when  environmental
assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs can be reasonably
estimated.  Generally,  the  timing  of  these  provisions  coincides  with  the
commitment  to a formal  plan of action  or, if  earlier,  on  divestment  or on
closure of inactive  sites.  The amount  recognized  is the best estimate of the
expenditure  required.  Where the liability  will not be settled for a number of
years  the  amount  recognized  is the  present  value of the  estimated  future
expenditure.

LEASES

     Assets  held  under  leases  which  result  in  Group  companies  receiving
substantially   all  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership   (finance  leases)  are
capitalized  as  tangible  fixed  assets  at  the  estimated  present  value  of
underlying  lease  payments.  The  corresponding  finance  lease  obligation  is
included with  borrowings.  Rentals under  operating  leases are charged against
income as incurred.

RESEARCH

     Expenditure on research is written off in the year in which it is incurred.

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

INTEREST

     Interest is capitalized  gross during the period of  construction  where it
relates  either  to the  financing  of  major  projects  with  long  periods  of
development or to dedicated  financing of other projects.  All other interest is
charged against income.

PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     The cost of providing pensions and other postretirement benefits is charged
to income on a systematic basis,  with pension surpluses and deficits  amortized
over the average  expected  remaining  service lives of current  employees.  The
difference  between the amounts charged to income and the contributions  made to
pension plans is included within other provisions or debtors as appropriate. The
amounts  accrued  for  other   postretirement   benefits  and  unfunded  pension
liabilities are included within other provisions.

DEFERRED TAXATION

     Deferred taxation is calculated,  using the liability method, in respect of
timing differences  arising primarily from the difference between the accounting
and tax treatments of both depreciation and petroleum revenue tax.  Provision is
made or recovery anticipated where timing differences are expected to reverse in
the foreseeable future.

DISCOUNTING

     The  unwinding of the discount on provisions  is included  within  interest
expense.  Any  change  in the  amount  recognized  for  environmental  and other
provisions arising through changes in discount rates is included within interest
expense.

COMPARATIVE FIGURES

     Certain previous years' figures have been restated to conform with the 1999
presentation.

SALES OF BUSINESSES AND FIXED ASSETS

     The  profit  on  sale of  businesses  during  1999  relates  mainly  to the
divestment  by the Group of its Canadian oil  properties  and certain  chemicals
businesses.  These  included  the  Verdugt  acid  salts  business;  the  Plaskon
electronics  materials  business  located in the USA and  Singapore;  and the US
Fibers and Yarns business. The profit on sale of businesses by joint ventures is
mainly  attributable to the disposal by the BP/Mobil joint venture of its retail
network in Hungary.

     The major  elements of the loss on sale of  businesses  or  termination  of
operations  in  1999  are the  disposal  by the  Group  of its  interest  in the
Pedernales  oil field in  Venezuela  and the  closure  of its  paraxylene  joint
venture in Singapore.

     For  1999  the  sale  of  fixed   assets   includes   the   Federal   Trade
Commission-mandated  sale of distribution  terminals and service stations in the
USA; the divestment by the Group of its interest in an olefins cracker at Wilton
in the UK and the sale and leaseback of US railcars.

     In 1998 the principal sales of businesses  were  exploration and production
properties  in the USA and Papua New  Guinea,  the  retail  network in the Czech
Republic,  the  Adibis  fuel  additives  business  and  a  speciality  chemicals
distribution  business.  The  profit  on sale of  businesses  by joint  ventures
relates  mainly to the  disposal  by the  BP/Mobil  joint  venture of its retail
network  in  Belgium.  In 1998 the  profit  on the sale of  fixed  assets  arose
principally  from the divestment of the refinery in Lima, Ohio, and the sale and
leaseback of the Amoco building in Chicago.

     In 1997 the major  disposals were the sale of US exploration and production
properties and an intrastate  natural gas pipeline in Texas.  Other  divestments
included oil  marketing  assets in Thailand and advanced  materials  and plastic
resin  businesses in the UK. The loss on sale of  businesses  by joint  ventures
related  principally to the costs of the BP/Mobil joint venture terminating base
oil manufacturing operations at Llandarcy in the UK.

     Additional  information on the sale of businesses and fixed assets is given
in Note 18 - Disposals.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

     These costs arising from restructuring  activity across the Group following
the  merger of BP and Amoco at the end of 1998 and relate  predominantly  to the
Group's US operations.  The major elements of the restructuring charges comprise
employee  severance costs ($1,212 million) and provisions to cover future rental
payments on surplus  leasehold  office  accommodation  and other  property ($297
million).  During 1999 some 16,000 employees left the Group through severance or
outsourcing arrangements.  Also included in the restructuring charges are office
closure costs,  contract  termination  payments and asset write-downs.  The cash
outflow for these restructuring charges during the year was $976 million.

MERGER EXPENSES

     BP Amoco incurred fees and expenses of $198 million in connection  with the
merger.  These costs relate  principally  to investment  banking fees as well as
legal, accounting and regulatory filing fees.

REFINERY NETWORK RATIONALIZATION

     The net charge for refinery network  rationalization in 1997 of $47 million
(1996 $24  million)  represents  the  balance of the costs  associated  with the
rationalization of the BP Amoco Group's international  refining system announced
in 1995.

EUROPEAN REFINING AND MARKETING JOINT VENTURE IMPLEMENTATION

     The one-off costs  associated with the setting up of the European  refining
and marketing  joint  venture with Mobil in 1997 were $265 million.  These costs
represent the BP Amoco Group's  share of charges for  severance,  restructuring,
rebranding and other implementation charges.

     The  rationalization  of office and other  facilities in 1999 following the
merger resulted in the write-off of redundant IT and other office  equipment and
furnishings.  This charge of $258 million has been included  within  exceptional
items.  In addition for 1999 the charge for  depreciation  includes $100 million
for the  impairment  of the  Badami  field in Alaska  and $123  million  for the
write-down of various Chemicals and Refining and Marketing assets.

     The  charge  for  depreciation  in  1998  included  $214  million  for  the
impairment  of the Opon field in Colombia and $61 million for the  write-down of
various other oil and natural gas  properties.  The impairment of the Opon field
reflected  lower than  anticipated  natural gas production  and related  reserve
estimates.  The charge also  reflected  impairment  of the adjacent  power plant
because  of the  unavailability  of an  economic  fuel  supply.  As a result  of
increased  economic  uncertainty  in Russia,  the Group wrote down the  carrying
value of its investment in A O Sidanco by $200 million.

     In assessing the value in use of potentially  impaired  assets,  a discount
rate of 10% has been used.

Diluted earnings per share.....................................   25.68    16.70    29.41
</TABLE>


     The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit
attributable to ordinary shareholders,  i.e. profit for the year less preference
dividends,  related to the weighted  average number of ordinary  shares in issue
during the year. The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the
subdivision (2 for 1 share split) of ordinary shares effective  October 4, 1999.
The profit attributable to ordinary  shareholders is $5,006 million (1998 $3,219
million  and 1997 $5,672  million).  The  average  number of shares  outstanding
excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.

     The  calculation  of  diluted   earnings  per  share  is  based  on  profit
attributable to ordinary  shareholders as for basic earnings per share. However,
the number of shares  outstanding is adjusted to show the potential  dilution if
employee  share  options  are  converted  into  ordinary  shares.  The number of
ordinary  shares  outstanding  for basic and diluted  earnings  per share may be
reconciled as follows:

     Where a borrowing  is swapped  into  another  currency,  the  borrowing  is
accounted in the swap currency and not in the original currency of denomination.
Total borrowings  include $91 million ($86 million at December 31, 1998) for the
carrying value of currency swaps and forward contracts.

     Included  within Other loans  repayable  within one year are US  Industrial
Revenue/Municipal  Bonds of $1,376  million  (December 31, 1998 $1,277  million)
with maturity  periods ranging up to 35 years.  They are classified as repayable
within one year, as required  under UK GAAP, as the  bondholders  typically have
the option to tender  these bonds for  repayment on interest  reset  dates.  Any
bonds that are tendered are usually  remarketed and BP Amoco has not experienced
any  significant  repurchases.  BP Amoco  considers  these  bonds  to  represent
long-term funding when assessing the maturity profile of its borrowings.

     Interest  rates on  borrowings  repayable  wholly or partly  more than five
years from December 31, 1999 range from 6% to 9% with a weighted  average of 7%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt is 6%.

     At December 31, 1999 the Group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing
facilities  available,  including $3,000 million ($2,800 million at December 31,
1998)  expiring in 2000.  These  facilities  are with a number of  international
banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed  rates.  Certain of these
facilities support the Group's commercial paper programme.

     The Group aims for a balance between floating and fixed interest rates and,
in 1999,  the Group's  upper limit for the  proportion of floating rate debt was
65% of total net debt  outstanding.  Aside from debt issued in the US  municipal
bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are
linked  principally to LIBOR,  while rates on debt in other currencies are based
on local  market  equivalents.  The Group  monitors  interest  rate risk using a
process of  sensitivity  analysis.  Assuming  no changes to the  borrowings  and
hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general level
of interest  rates on January 1, 2000 would  change  2000  profit  before tax by
approximately $80 million.

     The fair value and carrying  amounts of borrowings  shown above exclude the
effects of currency swaps,  interest rate swaps and forward contracts (which are
included for presentation in the balance sheet).  Long-term  borrowings  include
debt which  matures in the year from  December 31, 1999,  whereas in the balance
sheet  long-term debt of current  maturity is reported under amounts falling due
within   one   year.   Long-term   borrowings   also   include   US   Industrial
Revenue/Municipal  Bonds classified on the balance sheet as repayable within one
year. The carrying  amount of the Group's  short-term  borrowings,  which mainly
comprise  commercial  paper,  bank loans and overdrafts,  approximate their fair
value.  The fair value of the Group's  long-term  borrowings is estimated  using
quoted prices or, where these are not available,  discounted cash flow analyses,
based on the Group's current  incremental  borrowing rates for similar types and
maturities of borrowing.

NOTE 27 -- OTHER PROVISIONS (CONCLUDED)

     At December 31, 1999 the  provision  for the costs of  decommissioning  the
Group's oil and natural gas  production  facilities  and pipelines at the end of
their economic lives was $2,785 million. These costs are expected to be incurred
over  the  next 30  years.  The  provision  has been  estimated  using  existing
technology,  at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 3.5%
(3%).

     The provision for  environmental  liabilities  at 31 December 1999 was $917
million. This represents primarily the estimated  environmental  restoration and
remediation  costs for closed  sites or  facilities  that have been sold.  These
costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years. The provision has been
estimated using existing  technology,  at current prices, and discounted using a
real discount rate of 3.5% (3%).

     The Group also holds  provisions  for  potential  future  awards  under the
long-term performance plan, expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties and
sundry other liabilities.  To the extent that these liabilities are not expected
to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using a
real discount rate of 3.5% (3%).

NOTE 28 -- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     An  outline of the  Group's  major  financial  risks and the  policies  and
objectives  pursued in relation to these risks is set out in the financial  risk
management  section  of  Item  9 --  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 9A -- Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

     In the  normal  course  of  business  the  Group is a party  to  derivative
financial  instruments  (derivatives) with off-balance sheet risk,  primarily to
manage its  exposure to  fluctuations  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates and
interest rates,  including  management of the balance between  floating rate and
fixed rate debt. The Group also manages certain of its exposures to movements in
oil and natural gas prices. The underlying economic currency of the Group's cash
flows is mainly the US dollar.  Accordingly,  most of our  borrowings  are in US
dollars,  are hedged with respect to the US dollar or swapped into dollars where
this  achieves  a lower  cost of  financing.  Significant  non-dollar  cash flow
exposures are hedged.  Gains and losses arising on these hedges are deferred and
recognized in the income  statement or as  adjustments to carrying  amounts,  as
appropriate, only when the hedged item occurs. In addition, we trade derivatives
in conjunction with these risk management activities. The results of trading are
recognized in income in the current period.

     These derivatives involve, to varying degrees, credit and market risk. With
regard  to  credit  risk,  the  Group  may be  exposed  to loss in the  event of
non-performance  by a  counterparty.  The Group controls credit risk by entering
into  derivative  contracts  only with highly  credit-rated  counterparties  and
through credit approvals,  limits and monitoring procedures and does not usually
require  collateral or other security.  The Group has not  experienced  material
non-performance by any counterparty.

     Market risk is the possibility  that a change in interest  rates,  currency
exchange rates or oil and natural gas prices will cause the value of a financial
instrument to decrease or its obligations to become more costly to settle.  When
derivatives  are used for the purpose of risk  management they do not expose the
Group to market  risk  because  the  exposure  to  market  risk  created  by the
derivative is offset by the opposite exposure arising from the asset, liability,
cash flow or transaction  being hedged.  When  derivatives  are held for trading
purposes,  the exposure of the Group to market risk is  represented by potential
changes in their fair (market) values. The measurement of market risk in trading
activities is discussed further below.

     With the exception of the table of currency  exposures  shown on page F-36,
short-term   debtors  and  creditors  which  arise  directly  from  the  Group's
operations  have been excluded from the  disclosures  contained in this note, as
permitted by FRS13.

INTEREST RATE RISK

     The financial  liabilities upon which interest is paid comprise principally
borrowings and net obligations under finance leases.

     In managing its finance debt, the Group aims for a balance between floating
and  fixed  interest  rates  and,  in 1999,  the  Group's  upper  limit  for the
proportion of floating rate debt was 65% of total net debt outstanding. Interest
rate swaps are used by the Group to modify the interest  characteristics  of its
long-term  borrowings  from a fixed to a floating rate basis or vice versa.  The

     In accordance with its policy for managing its foreign  exchange rate risk,
the Group  enters into  various  types of foreign  exchange  contracts,  such as
currency swaps,  forwards and options.  The fair values and carrying  amounts of
these derivatives are shown in the fair value disclosures below.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

     The estimated fair value of the Group's  financial  instruments is shown in
the table below. The table also shows the `net carrying amount' of the financial
asset or liability. This amount represents the net book value, i.e. market value
when acquired or later marked to market. The carrying amounts and fair values of
finance debt shown below  exclude the effects of interest  rate swaps,  currency
swaps and forward  contracts (which are included for presentation in the balance
sheet).  Current  maturities  of  long-term  finance  debt  are  included  under
long-term finance debt.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 28 -- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

     Interest rate contracts  include  futures  contracts,  swap  agreements and
options. Foreign exchange contracts include forward and futures contracts,  swap
agreements  and  options.  Oil and natural gas price  contracts  are those which
require  settlement in cash and include futures  contracts,  swap agreements and
options and cash-settled  commodity instruments  (derivative commodity contracts
that permit  settlement  either by delivery of the  underlying  commodity  or in
cash) such as forward contracts.

     The following  methods and assumptions were used by the Group in estimating
its fair value  disclosures  for its  financial  instruments:  Current  assets -
Debtors - amounts  falling due after more than one year: The fair value of other
debtors due after one year is estimated not to be materially  different from its
carrying value.

     Current  assets -  Investments  and Cash at bank and in hand:  The carrying
amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted current asset  investments and
cash at bank and in hand approximates their fair value. The fair value of listed
current asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.

     Finance debt:  The carrying  amount of the Group's  short-term  borrowings,
which mainly comprise commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts,  approximates
their fair value. The fair value of the Group's long-term borrowings and finance
lease  obligations  is  estimated  using  quoted  prices or, where these are not
available,   discounted  cash  flow  analyses,  based  on  the  Group's  current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.

     Creditors - amounts falling due after more than one year - Other creditors:
These  liabilities  are  predominantly  interest-free.  In  view  of  the  short
maturities,  the reported  carrying  amount is estimated to approximate the fair
value.

     Provisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  - Other  provisions:  Where the
liability will not be settled for a number of years the amount recognized is the
present  value of the  estimated  future  expenditure.  The  carrying  amount of
provisions for onerous contracts thus approximates the fair value.

     Derivative  financial  or  commodity  instruments:  The fair  values of the
Group's  interest rate contracts  (swaps) are based on pricing models which take
into account  relevant market data. Fair values for the Group's foreign exchange
contracts (forward  contracts,  swap agreements and options) are based on market
prices of comparable instruments. The fair values of the Group's oil and natural
gas price contracts  (futures  contracts,  swap agreements,  options and forward
contracts) are based on market prices.

RISK MANAGEMENT

     Gains and  losses on  derivatives  used for risk  management  purposes  are
deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments  to carrying  amounts,  as
appropriate,  when the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs.
When an anticipated  transaction is no longer likely to occur or finance debt is
terminated  before  maturity,  any deferred  gain or loss that has arisen on the
related derivative is recognized in the income statement, together with any gain
or loss on the terminated item. Where such derivatives used for hedging purposes
are  terminated  before the  underlying  debt matures or the hedged  transaction
occurs,  the  resulting  gain or loss is recognized on a basis which matches the
timing and accounting  treatment of the underlying hedged item. The unrecognized
and  carried-forward  gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging,  and the
movements therein, are shown in the following table.

been  neutralized,  with trading  initiatives being concluded by taking opposite
positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero net market risk.

     The  following  table  shows the fair value at the year end and the average
net fair value of derivatives and other financial  instruments  held for trading
purposes during the year.

     The Group measures its market risk exposure, i.e. potential gain or loss in
fair  values,  on its trading  activity  using a value at risk  technique.  This
technique  is based  on a  variance/covariance  model  and  makes a  statistical
assessment  of the market risk arising from  possible  future  changes in market
values over a 24-hour period.  The calculation of the range of potential changes
in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures, and the
history of one-day price  movements  over the previous 12 months,  together with
the correlation of these price movements.  The potential movement in fair values
is  expressed  to  three  standard  deviations  which is  equivalent  to a 99.7%
confidence  level.  This means that, in broad terms,  one would expect to see an
increase or a decrease in fair values greater than the value at risk on only one
occasion per year if the portfolio were left unchanged.

     The Group  calculates  value at risk on all  instruments  that are held for
trading  purposes and that  therefore give an exposure to market risk. The value
at risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments such as interest
rate forward and futures  contracts,  swap  agreements,  options and  swaptions,
foreign exchange forward and futures contracts,  swap agreements and options and
oil price futures, swap agreements and options. Financial assets and liabilities
and  physical  crude  oil and  refined  products  that are  treated  as  trading
positions are also included in these calculations. The value at risk calculation
for oil price exposure also includes derivative commodity instruments (commodity
contracts that permit settlement either by delivery of the underlying  commodity
or in cash) such as forward contracts.

     The presentation of trading results shown below includes certain activities
of the  Group's  oil  trading  division  which  involve  the  use of  derivative
financial  instruments in conjunction with physical and paper trading of oil. It
is  considered  that a more  comprehensive  representation  of the  Group's  oil
trading activities is given by the classification of the gains or losses on such
derivatives along with those arising from the physical and paper trades to which
they relate.

     The following  table shows the trading income arising from  derivatives and
other financial instruments.  For oil price contract trading, this also includes
income or losses  arising on trading of  derivative  commodity  instruments  and
physical oil trades, representing the net result of the oil-trading portfolio.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The following  information is presented in  amplification of the accounting
policies presented in Note 1 -- Accounting policies.

REPORTING IN THE INCOME STATEMENT

     Gains and  losses  on oil price  contracts  held for  trading  and for risk
management purposes are reported in cost of sales in the income statement in the
period in which the change in value occurs. Gains and losses on interest rate or
foreign  currency  derivatives used for trading are reported in other income and
cost of sales, respectively.  Gains and losses in respect of derivatives used to
manage  interest  rate  exposures  are  recognized  as  adjustments  to interest
expense.

     Where  derivatives  are used to convert  non-US  dollar  borrowing  into US
dollars,  the gains and losses are  deferred and  recognized  on maturity of the
underlying  debt,  together with the matching loss or gain on the debt.  The two
amounts offset each other in the income statement.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 28 -- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

     Gains and losses on derivatives  identified as hedges of significant non-US
dollar firm commitments or anticipated transactions are not recognized until the
hedged  transaction  occurs.  The  treatment  of the gain or loss arising on the
designated derivative reflects the nature and accounting treatment of the hedged
item.  The gain or loss is recorded in cost of sales in the income  statement or
as an adjustment to carrying values in the balance sheet, as appropriate.

     Gains and losses arising from natural gas price  derivatives are recognized
in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs. The gains or losses are reported
as components of the related transactions.

REPORTING IN THE BALANCE SHEET

     The carrying amounts of foreign exchange  contracts that hedge finance debt
are included within finance debt in the balance sheet.  The carrying  amounts of
other derivatives,  including option premiums paid or received,  are included in
the  balance  sheet under  receivables  or payables  within  current  assets and
current liabilities respectively, as appropriate.

CASH FLOW EFFECTS

     Interest rate swaps give rise, at specified  intervals,  to cash settlement
of interest  differentials.  Under currency swaps the  counterparties  initially
exchange a  principal  amount in two  currencies,  agreeing to  re-exchange  the
currencies  at a future date at the same  exchange  rate.  The Group's  currency
swaps have terms of up to six years.

     Interest  rate  futures   require  an  initial  margin  payment  and  daily
settlement of margin calls.  Interest  rate forwards  require  settlement of the
interest rate differential on a specified future date. Currency forwards require
purchase or sale of an agreed amount of foreign currency at a specified exchange
rate at a specified  future date,  generally  over periods of up to one year for
the Group.  Currency options involve the initial payment or receipt of a premium
and will give rise to  delivery  of an agreed  amount of currency at a specified
future date if the option is exercised.

     For oil and natural  gas price  futures  and  options  traded on  regulated
exchanges,  BP Amoco meets initial margin  requirements  by bank  guarantees and
daily margin calls in cash.  For swaps and  over-the-counter  options,  BP Amoco
settles with the counterparty on conclusion of the pricing period.

     In the statement of cash flows the effect of interest rate  derivatives  is
reflected in interest paid. The effect of foreign currency  derivatives used for
hedging non-US dollar debt is included under financing. The cash flow effects of
foreign  currency  derivatives  used to hedge non-US dollar firm commitments and
anticipated  transactions  are  included  in  net  cash  inflow  from  operating
activities  for  items  relating  to  earnings  or  in  capital  expenditure  or
acquisitions,  as  appropriate,  for  items of a capital  nature.  The cash flow
effects of all oil and natural gas price derivatives and all traded  derivatives
are included in net cash inflow from operating activities.

     The carrying amounts of foreign exchange  contracts that hedge finance debt
are included within finance debt in the balance sheet.  The carrying  amounts of
other  derivatives  are  included in the  balance  sheet  under  receivables  or
payables as appropriate.

     In addition to the above financial instruments,  the Group has issued third
party  guarantees  and  indemnities  amounting to $458 million  ($436 million at
December  31,  1998).  The credit risk and  maximum  cash  requirement  of these
guarantees and indemnities is the full contractual  amount,  however no material
loss is expected to arise.

     The following  information is presented in compliance with the requirements
of FASB Statement of Accounting  Standards  No.105 -- `Disclosure of Information
about  Financial   Instruments   with   Off-Balance-Sheet   Risk  and  Financial
Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk'.

     The table  shows the 'fair  value'  of the asset or  liability  created  by
derivatives.  This represents the market value at the balance sheet date. Credit
exposure at December 31 is represented by the column 'fair value asset'.

     The table also shows the 'net  carrying  amount' of the asset or  liability
created by derivatives.  This amount  represents the net book value, i.e. market
value when acquired or later marked to market.

     Interest  rate swaps allow BP Amoco to modify the interest  characteristics
of its long-term borrowings from a fixed to a floating rate basis or vice versa.
Under interest rate swaps,  the Group agrees with other parties to exchange,  at
specified intervals,  the interest  differentials  calculated by reference to an
agreed  notional  principal  amount.  There  is no  exchange  of the  underlying
principal amount.

     Interest rate futures  contracts may be used by the Group, on occasion,  in
preference  to interest  rate swaps to achieve a more cost  effective  method of
managing  the mix between  fixed and floating  rate debt.  These  contracts  are
commitments to either  purchase or sell  designated  financial  instruments at a
future  date  for a  specified  price,  and may be  settled  in cash or  through
delivery.  The Group holds highly  liquid  contracts,  such as US Treasury  bond
futures,  with terms ranging up to a year. Initial margin requirements and daily
calls are met either by the deposit of securities or in cash.  Futures contracts
have little credit risk as regulated exchanges are the counterparties.

     Interest rate forward contracts,  which include forward rate agreements and
options  on  forward  rate  agreements,  may also be used by the Group to manage
interest  rate risk on debt.  These  contracts  are  agreements  which allow the
interest  rate cost on a  principal  amount to be fixed for a  specified  period
commencing on a future date.

     Swaptions  may also be employed  to manage  interest  rate risk on debt.  A
swaption is an agreement that conveys the right, but not the obligation, to swap
a series of fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest payments, or
vice versa,  at a given future point in time.  Typically the  swaptions  entered
into by the Group are cash settled at expiry.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

managing its foreign exchange risk as indicated in the following table:

NOTE 28 -- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

     The Group's  foreign  exchange  management  policy is to minimize  economic
exposures  from currency  movements  against the US dollar.  This is achieved by
raising finance in US dollars, hedging with respect to the US dollar or swapping
into US dollars  where this  achieves a lower  cost of  financing,  and  hedging
significant non-dollar cash flows. Examples of significant non-dollar cash flows
are  sterling-based  capital lease  payments,  sterling tax payments and capital
expenditure and operational requirements of Exploration in the UK.

     Under  currency  swaps the  counterparties  initially  exchange a principal
amount in two  currencies,  agreeing to  re-exchange  the currencies at a future
date and at the same  exchange  rate.  In  addition,  interest  payments  in the
respective  currencies are exchanged at specified intervals over the term of the
agreement.  The Group's  currency swaps have terms up to six years. The majority
of the Group's  currency  swaps  relate to major  currencies  such as  Sterling,
Deutschmarks, Swiss Francs and Japanese Yen.

     Currency  forward  contracts are  commitments to purchase or sell an agreed
amount of foreign  currency at a specified  exchange rate at a specified  future
date. The Group's forward  contracts are generally settled over periods of up to
one year.

     Currency options, which are normally directly negotiated,  allow but do not
require,  the  holder  to buy from or sell to the  writer  an  agreed  amount of
currency at a specified  exchange rate within a stated  period,  and involve the
initial  payment or receipt of a premium.  The Group's option  contracts have an
average term of less than one year.

     Included in currency  options are currency  cylinder  option  contracts.  A
cylinder  is  the  purchase  of an  option  to  buy  foreign  currency  and  the
simultaneous selling of an option to sell the same amount of foreign currency to
BP Amoco at a different  exchange  rate. The effect is to limit the risk of both
gain and loss.  This is  achieved  at little or no cost as the  symmetry  of the
options  means that the  premium  paid for one option is balanced by the premium
received from the sale of the other.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT

     The Group enters into various types of oil and natural gas price  contracts
to manage its exposure to some movements in  hydrocarbon  prices as indicated in
the following table. Contracts which are capable of being settled by delivery of
oil, oil products or natural gas are excluded.

NOTE 28 -- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

     The Group uses swaps,  options and futures to hedge  future  purchases  and
sales  of  crude  oil and  refined  oil  products.  The  term  of the oil  price
derivatives  is  usually  less than one year.  Natural  gas swaps,  options  and
futures are used to convert  specific  sales and purchase  contracts  from fixed
prices  to  market  prices.  Swaps  are also  used to hedge  exposure  for price
differentials between locations.  The term of most natural gas price derivatives
is less than one year, with some having terms of two years.

     Under  swaps,  BP Amoco  agrees  with other  parties to pay or receive  the
difference  between a fixed and  variable  price at a range of  specified  dates
determined by reference to an agreed notional volume.

     The  option  and  futures  contracts  are  traded on  regulated  exchanges.
Exchange-traded options allow, but do not require, the holder to either buy from
or sell to the writer an agreed amount of futures contracts at a specified price
at a specified future date.  Futures are fixed price  commitments to purchase or
sell a  contract,  whose  value is derived  from the price of oil at a specified
future date.  Initial margin  requirements  and daily cash  settlements for both
these types of contracts are met either by bank guarantees or in cash.  There is
little  credit  risk  under  these  contracts  as  regulated  exchanges  are the
counterparties.

TRADING ACTIVITIES

     The Group maintains  active trading  positions in a variety of derivatives.
This activity is undertaken in  conjunction  with risk  management.  Derivatives
held for trading  purposes are marked to market and any gain or loss  recognized
in the  income  statement.  For traded  derivatives,  many  positions  have been
neutralized,  with  trading  initiatives  being  concluded  by  taking  opposite
positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero net market risk.

     The  following  table  discloses  the contract or notional  amount and fair
value of the derivatives held for trading purposes at December 31, 1999 and 1998
and the average fair value for the year.

the option is granted.  The option price is usually set at a 20% discount to the
market  price at the time of grant.  The  option  must be  exercised  within six
months of maturity of the savings contract otherwise it lapses.  Similar schemes
are run in a number of overseas countries.

     Under  the  UK  Participating  Scheme,  BP  Amoco  matches  employees'  own
contribution of shares, up to a predetermined  limit, all of which are then held
in trust for defined  periods before being  released to the employee.  There are
similar schemes in a number of overseas countries.

     The Company  sponsors a number of savings plans covering most US employees.
Under these plans, employees may contribute up to 20% of their salary subject to
certain  regulatory  limits.  BP Amoco matches employee  contributions up to 7%,
depending upon length of service.  The plans invest  primarily in BP Amoco ADSs.
The  Company's   contributions  vest  over  a  period  of  five  years.  Company
contributions  to  savings  plans  during  the year were $95  million  (1998 $91
million).

     During 1999, BP Amoco granted  options under the BP Amoco Share Option Plan
to certain categories of employees.  Prior to 1999, BP and Amoco granted options
under the BP Executive  Share Option Scheme (BP ESOS) and the Amoco Stock Option
Plan respectively. Options were granted to former Amoco employees who, under the
terms of the merger agreement between BP and Amoco,  must, for 1999 and 2000, be
granted  options on a similar  basis to the  arrangements  under the Amoco Stock
Option Plan.  Options were also granted to certain  former BP US employees.  The
options  were  granted  at the market  price at the date of grant.  There are no
performance  conditions  attaching to these grants.  The options are exercisable
one or two years after the date of grant, and lapse after 10 years.

     Also in 1999, options were granted to non-US middle managers in prior years
these were granted  under the BP ESOS.  The options were granted at market price
at the date of grant and are not  exercisable  until a performance  condition is
satisfied.  Before any options can be exercised, the Remuneration Committee will
require  the  total  return  to  shareholders  (share  price  increase  with all
dividends  reinvested)  on an  investment  in BP Amoco shares to exceed the mean
total  return to  shareholders  of a  representative  group of UK companies by a
margin set from time to time by the committee.  The performance  period for each
grant will normally be three years.  Subject to achievement  of the  performance
conditions,   the   options  are   exercisable   between  the  third  and  tenth
anniversaries of the date of grant.

     An Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) has been  established to acquire BP
Amoco shares to satisfy future  requirements of certain  employee share schemes.
Funding is provided to the ESOP by the Company.  The assets and  liabilities  of
the ESOP are  recognized as assets and  liabilities  of the Company within these
accounts. The ESOP has waived its rights to dividends.

     During 1999 the ESOP released 8,779,000 shares for the participating  share
schemes. The cost of shares released for these schemes has been charged in these
accounts.  At December 31, 1999 the ESOP held  53,989,000  shares  (December 31,
1998, 62,768,000).

NOTE 33 -- EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES (CONTINUED)

     BP Amoco has  established  a  Qualifying  Employee  Share  Ownership  Trust
(QUEST) for the purposes of share option  schemes for UK employees and executive
directors of the company and its subsidiaries. During the year, contributions of
$61 million ($42 million) were made by the Company to the QUEST which,  together
with  option-holder  contributions,  were used by the QUEST to subscribe for new
ordinary  shares  at  market  price.  The  cost of this  contribution  has  been
transferred  by the Company  directly to retained  profits and the excess of the
subscription price over nominal value has increased the share premium account.

     At December 31, 1999, all the 9,672,542 ordinary shares issued to the QUEST
had been  transferred  to option holders  exercising  options under the UK Group
Savings Related Share Option Scheme.

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 33 -- EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES (CONCLUDED)

     As  allowed  by SFAS 123  `Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation'  the
Company has elected to continue to follow  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion
No. 25,  'Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees'.  In accordance  with this
accounting statement the Company does not recognize  compensation expense on the
grant of the options.  Had  compensation  expense been determined based upon the
fair value of the stock options at grant date consistent with the method of SFAS
123, the  Company's  profit for the year and profit per Ordinary  Share for 1999
would have been  reduced by $65 million  (1998 $47 million and 1997 $43 million)
and 1 cent (1998 1 cent and 1997 1 cent), respectively.

     The weighted  average fair value of BP Amoco share options  granted in 1999
was $2.27 (1998 $2.29 and 1997  $2.97).  The fair value of each option grant was
estimated on the date of grant using a  Black-Scholes  option pricing model with
the  following  assumptions  for 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively;  risk-free
interest  rates of 6.5, 6.0 and 7.0%;  dividend  yield of 3%;  expected lives of
three to five years and volatility of 32%, 18% and 18%.

     In 1998 and earlier  years Amoco had granted stock  options.  Following the
merger between BPand Amoco these were converted into BPAmoco share options.  The
weighted average fair value of Amoco stock options granted in 1998 was $7.40 and
in 1997 was $8.41.  On the basis of BP Amoco  shares  these  equate to values of
$1.86 and $2.12 respectively.  The fair value of each option grant was estimated
on the  date of  grant  using a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with the
following  assumptions for 1998 and 1997 respectively;  risk-free interest rates
of 5.7 and 6.7, dividend yield of 4%, expected lives of six years and volatility
of 17%.

     The  effects of  applying  SFAS 123 for the  proforma  disclosures  are not
representative  of the effects  expected  on reported  net income and profit per
Ordinary  Share  in  future  years,   since  the   disclosures  do  not  reflect
compensation expense for options granted prior to 1995.

NOTE 34 -- LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

     Senior executives and the executive directors  participate in the Long Term
Performance  Plan  (the  Plan).  This is an  incentive  scheme  under  which the
Remuneration  Committee may award shares to participants or fund the purchase of
shares for  participants  if long-term  targets are met.  The Plan  replaced the
granting of executive share options to  participants,  apart from those based in
North  America  who will  continue to receive  share  options in line with local
market practice.

     The  cost of  potential  future  awards  is  accrued  over  the  three-year
performance periods of each Plan. In any one year, three Plans are in operation.
The  amount  charged in 1999 was $128  million  (1998 $45  million  and 1997 $28
million).

     The value of awards  under the  1996-98  Plan made in 1999 was $52  million
(1995-97 Plan $36 million).

     Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) have been  established to acquire BP
Amoco shares to satisfy any awards made to  particpants  under the Plan and then
to hold them for the  participants  during the retention  period of the Plan. In
order to hedge the cost of potential  future  awards the ESOPs may, from time to
time over the performance  period of the Plans,  purchase BP Amoco shares in the
open  market.  Funding is provided to the ESOPs by the  Company.  The assets and
liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the Company
within these accounts. The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends.

     At December 31, 1999 the ESOPs held 9,502,000 (1998,  6,266,000) shares for
potential future awards.

NOTE 38 -- PENSIONS

      Most Group  companies have pension plans,  the forms and benefits of which
vary with  conditions and practices in the countries  concerned.  The main plans
provide  benefits that are computed based on an employee's  years of service and
final pensionable  salary.  In most cases Group companies make  contributions to
separately administered trusts, based on advice from independent actuaries using
actuarial  methods,  the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet
pension  obligations  as they  fall  due.  In  certain  countries  the plans are
unfunded and the accrued  liabilities  for pension  benefits is included  within
other provisions.

     The net credit to income for  pensions in 1999 was $97  million  (1998 $139
million  net charge and 1997 $141  million  net  charge).  This was  assessed in
accordance  with  independent  actuarial  advice using the projected unit credit
method for the Group's  major  pension  plans.  The net credit for 1999 includes
settlement and curtailment  gains of $150 million arising from the high level of
severance during the year.

     The principal  assumptions  used in calculating the  credit/charge  for the
principle plans were as follows:

     At January 1, 1999 the date of the latest actuarial  valuations or reviews,
the market value of assets in the Group's major externally  funded pension plans
in the UK and the USA was $23,209 million  ($20,689 million at January 1, 1998).
The actuarial value of the assets of these plans represented 125% (1998 123%) of
the  benefits  that had accrued to members of those  plans,  after  allowing for
expected future increases in salaries.

     At December 31, 1999 the obligation for accrued  benefits in respect of the
principal  unfunded  plans in Europe  was  $1,513  million  ($1,714  million  at
December 31, 1998).  Of this amount,  $1,234 million ($1,345 million at December
31, 1998) has been provided in these accounts.

NOTE 39 -- OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     Certain  Group  companies,   principally  in  the  United  States,  provide
postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to their retired employees
and  dependants.  The  entitlement  to these  benefits  is usually  based on the
employee  remaining in service until  retirement age and completion of a minimum
period of service. The plans are partly funded and the accrued net liability for
postretirement benefits is included within other provisions.

     The charge to income for  postretirement  benefits  in 1999 of $42  million
(1998 $101  million  and 1997 $110  million)  was  assessed in  accordance  with
independent  actuarial advice using the projected unit credit method. The charge
for 1999 is net of a curtailment gain of $62 million arising from the high level
of severance during the year.

     At  December  31,  1999  the  independent  actuaries  have  reassessed  the
obligation  for  postretirement  benefits at $1,638 million  ($1,814  million at
December 31, 1998).  The provision for  postretirement  benefits at December 31,
1999 was $2,244 million ($2,311 million at December 31, 1998).

     The discount  rate used to assess the  obligation  at December 31, 1999 was
7.5% (6.5% at December 31, 1998). The assumed future  healthcare cost trend rate
for 2000 and subsequent years is 5%.

NOTE 40 -- CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

     There  were  contingent  liabilities  at  December  31,  1999 in respect of
guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of, and claims arising from, the
ordinary  course of the  Group's  business,  upon which no  material  losses are
likely to arise.

     Approximately 200 lawsuits were filed in State and Federal Courts in Alaska
seeking  compensatory  and punitive  damages arising out of the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Prince  William  Sound in March  1989.  Most of those suits named Exxon
(now ExxonMobil), Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (Alyeska), which operates the
oil terminal at Valdez,  and the other oil companies which own Alyeska.  Alyeska
initially  responded to the spill until the response was taken over by Exxon. BP
Amoco owns a 50%  interest in Alyeska  through a  subsidiary  of BP America Inc.
Alyeska and its owners have  settled all of the claims  against them under these
lawsuits.  Exxon has indicated that it may file a claim for contribution against
Alyeska for a portion of the costs and  damages  which it has  incurred.  If any
claims are asserted by Exxon which affect Alyeska and its owners, BP Amoco would
defend the claims vigorously.

     The Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS) has  challenged  the  application  of
certain foreign income taxes as credits against BP Amoco  Corporation's US taxes
that  otherwise  would have been payable for the years 1980 to 1992. On June 18,
1992, the IRS issued a statutory  Notice of Deficiency  for additional  taxes in
the amount of $466 million,  plus  interest,  relating to 1980 to 1982. BP Amoco
filed a petition  in the US Tax Court  contesting  the IRS  statutory  Notice of
Deficiency.  Trial on the matter  was held in April  1995,  and a  decision  was
rendered by the US Tax Court in March  1996,  in BP Amoco's  favor.  The IRS has
appealed  the Tax  Court's  decision  to the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit and on March 11, 1998 the Seventh Circuit affirmed the Tax Court's prior
decision. A comparable  adjustment of foreign tax credits for each year has been
proposed  for the years  1983 to 1992  based  upon  subsequent  IRS  audits.  In
November  1999,  BP Amoco  Corporation  reached an  agreement  with the IRS that
effectively  resolves  this  issue  at a  minimal  tax cost to the  company.  On
13December1999  the parties  filed a status report with the US Tax Court for the
years 1983-1989  advising the Court that a basis for settlement had been reached
and that final  calculations  were in the process of being prepared.  Once these
calculations  are  finalized,  the  parties  expect to file an  agreed  decision
document  for  the  Court's  final  approval,   which  will  then  conclude  the
litigation.

     The Group is subject to numerous national and local  environmental laws and
regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities. These laws
and  regulations  may require the Group to take future  action to remediate  the
effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemical or petroleum
substances  by the  Group or other  parties.  Such  contingencies  may exist for
various  sites  including  refineries,  chemical  plants,  oil  fields,  service
stations,  terminals and waste disposal sites.  In addition,  the Group may have
obligations  relating to prior asset sales or closed  facilities.  The  ultimate
requirement for  remediation  and its cost is inherently  difficult to estimate.
However, the estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided
in these accounts in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.  While the
amounts  of future  costs  could be  significant  and could be  material  to the
Group's  results of  operations in the period in which they are  recognized,  BP
Amoco  does not expect  these  costs to have a  material  effect on the  Group's
financial position or liquidity.

NOTE 43 -- NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD

     The BP Amoco Group adopted Financial  Reporting Standard No.12 `Provisions,
Contingent  Liabilities and Contingent  Assets' (FRS12) with effect from January
1, 1999. This standard changes the criteria for recognizing  provisions for such
costs as  decommissioning,  environmental  liabilities,  onerous  contracts  and
restructuring charges. It also requires provisions for liabilities which may not
be settled for a number of years to be  discounted  to their net present  value.
The adoption of this standard has been treated as a change in accounting policy.
Comparative  figures  have been  restated to reflect  this change in  accounting
policy.

     The principal effects of the adoption of FRS12 are as follows:

(a)  Provisions  for  environmental  liabilities  are determined on a discounted
     basis as the  effect  of the time  value of money is  material.  Previously
     these liabilities were on an undiscounted basis.

(b)  Provisions  for  decommissioning  are  recognized  in full, on a discounted
     basis, at the commencement of oil and natural gas production.  The BP Amoco
     Group's prior  practice was to accrue the expected cost of  decommissioning
     oil and natural gas  production  facilities on a  unit-of-production  basis
     over the life of the  field.  FRS12  also  requires  the BP Amoco  Group to
     capitalize an amount  equivalent to the provision as a tangible fixed asset
     and  to   amortize   this   amount   over  the  life  of  the  field  on  a
     unit-of-production basis.

(c)  The unwinding of the discount, which represents a period-by-period cost, is
     included within interest expense.

NOTE 43 -- NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD (CONCLUDED)

(d)  Liabilities in respect of certain onerous  contracts have been  recognized.


     The effect of the change in accounting policy has been for 1999 to increase
total replacement cost operating profit and profit for the year, and for 1998 to
increase total  replacement  cost operating profit and reduce the profit for the
year as set out below.

NOTE 44 -- US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

     The consolidated financial statements of the BP Amoco Group are prepared in
accordance  with UK GAAP which  differs in certain  respects  from US GAAP.  The
principal  differences  between US GAAP and UK GAAP for BP Amoco Group reporting
relate to the following:

(A)  GROUP CONSOLIDATION

     Investments  in  entities  over which the Group does not  exercise  control
     (associates and joint ventures) are accounted for by the equity method.

     UK GAAP requires the consolidated  financial  statements to show separately
     the  Group  proportion  of  operating  profit or loss,  exceptional  items,
     inventory  holding  gains or  losses,  interest  expense  and  taxation  of
     associated  undertakings  and joint  ventures.  In addition the turnover of
     joint  ventures  should be disclosed.  For US GAAP the after tax profits or
     losses (i.e.  operating results after exceptional items,  inventory holding
     gains or losses,  interest expense and taxation) are included in the income
     statement as a single line item.

     UK  GAAP  requires  the  Group's  share  of  the  gross  assets  and  gross
     liabilities  of joint ventures to be shown on the face of the balance sheet
     whereas under US GAAP the net investment is included as a single line item.

     Where the Group conducts activities through a joint arrangement that is not
     carrying on a trade or business in its own right the Group accounts for its
     own assets,  liabilities and cash flows of the activity measured  according
     to the terms of the  arrangement.  For the Group this method of  accounting
     applies to certain oil and natural gas activities  and undivided  interests
     in  pipelines.  US GAAP  requires  these  activities to be accounted for by
     proportional consolidation, which is equivalent to UK GAAP.

NOTE 44-- US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (CONTINUED)

(C)  EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS

     Under UK GAAP certain exceptional items are shown separately on the face of
     the income  statement  after operating  profit.  These items are profits or
     losses  on  the  sale  of  businesses  and  fixed  assets  and  fundamental
     restructuring  charges.  Under  US  GAAP  these  items  are  classified  as
     operating income or expenses.

(D)  IMPAIRMENT

     Both UK and US GAAP require that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
     intangibles  to be held and used by an entity be  reviewed  for  impairment
     whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying
     amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  US GAAP requires, in performing
     the review for recoverability, the entity to estimate the future cash flows
     expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual  disposition.
     If the sum of the  expected  future  cash flows  (undiscounted  and without
     interest  charges)  is less  than the  carrying  amount  of the  asset,  an
     impairment loss is recognized. Otherwise, no impairment loss is recognized.
     Measurement of an impairment  loss for long-lived  assets and  identifiable
     intangibles  that an  entity  expects  to hold and use is based on the fair
     value of the assets.

     For UK GAAP to the extent that the carrying  amount exceeds the recoverable
     amount,  that is the higher of net realizable  value and value in use (fair
     value) the fixed asset is written down to its recoverable amount.

     No UK/US GAAP adjustment was required for impairment.

(E)  PROVISIONS

     UK GAAP requires provisions for decommissioning,  environmental liabilities
     and onerous  contracts to be determined on a discounted basis if the effect
     of the time  value of money is  material.  Under US GAAP (i)  environmental
     liabilities  are  discounted  only where the timing and amounts of payments
     are fixed and reliably determinable and (ii) provisions for decommissioning
     are provided on a unit-of-production basis over field lives.

     The  adjustments  for   decommissioning   expense,   interest  expense  and
     decommissioning  and  environmental  provisions  arise from the differences
     between the UK and US GAAP bases for determining provisions

(F)  DEFERRED TAXATION

     Under the UK GAAP restricted  liability  method,  deferred taxation is only
     provided  where  timing   differences   are  expected  to  reverse  in  the
     foreseeable  future.  Under  US GAAP  deferred  taxation  is  provided  for
     temporary  differences  between the financial  reporting  basis and the tax
     basis of the Group's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates.

     US GAAP requires the  recognition  of a deferred tax asset or liability for
     the tax  effects of  differences  between the  assigned  values and the tax
     bases of assets  acquired and  liabilities  assumed in a purchase  business
     combination,  whereas under US GAAP no such deferred tax asset or liability
     is  recognized.  Under US GAAP the  deferred  tax  asset  or  liability  is
     amortized  over the same period as the assets and  liabilities  to which it
     relates.

     The adjustments for fixed assets,  depreciation and deferred taxation arise
     from the  difference  between  the UK GAAP and US GAAP  bases for  deferred
     taxation.

(F)  DEFERRED TAXATION (CONCLUDED)

     At December 31, 1999, the adjustment to the carrying amount of fixed assets
     was $1,210  million  ($1,325  million at December 31, 1998) and the related
     deferred  tax  liability  $1,145  million  ($1,236  million at December 31,
     1998).  The charge for  depreciation in 1999 in respect of these assets was
     $115 million  (1998 $123 million and 1997 $162  million) and the credit for
     taxation $91 million (1998 $256 million and 1997 $166  million).  The UK/US
     GAAP adjustment for deferred taxation may be summarized as follows:

NOTE 44-- US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (CONTINUED)

(G)  ORDINARY SHARES HELD FOR FUTURE AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES

     Under UK GAAP,  Company shares held by an Employee Share  Ownership Plan to
     meet future  requirements  of employee  share  schemes are  recorded in the
     balance sheet as Fixed assets --  investments.  Under US GAAP,  such shares
     are recorded in the balance sheet as a reduction of shareholders' interest.

(H)  SALE AND LEASEBACK

     The sale and leaseback of the Amoco  building in Chicago,  Illinois in 1998
     is  treated  as a sale for UK GAAP  whereas  for US GAAP it is treated as a
     financing transaction.

     A  provision  was  recognized  under  UK GAAP in 1999 to cover  the  likely
     shortfall on rental income from subletting the Chicago office building.  As
     the original  sale and  leaseback was not treated as a sale for US GAAP the
     provision has been reversed for US GAAP.

     Under UK GAAP the profit  arising on the sale and  operating  leaseback  of
     certain  railcars  in 1999 is taken to  income  in the  period in which the
     transaction occurs. Under US GAAP this profit is not recognized immediately
     but amortised over the term of the operating lease.

(I)  DIVIDENDS

     Under UK GAAP,  dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they
     are  announced or declared by the board of  directors to the  shareholders.
     Under US GAAP,  dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are
     declared.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

     Under US GAAP  Trade  and  Other  receivables  due after one year of $3,455
million at December 31, 1999 ($3,305  million at December  31,  1998),  included
within  current  assets,  would  have  been  classified  as  noncurrent  assets.
Borrowing  under  US  Industrial   Revenue/Municipal  Bonds  of  $1,376  million
(December 31,1998 $1,277 million) included within current liabilities -- falling
due within  one year  would  under US GAAP have been  classified  as  noncurrent
liabilities.  The  provision  for  deferred  taxation is primarily in respect of
noncurrent items.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

     The Group's financial  statements include a consolidated  statement of cash
flows in  accordance  with the revised UK  Financial  Reporting  Standard  No. 1
(FRS1).  The  statement  prepared  under FRS1  presents  substantially  the same
information  as that  required  under FASB  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 95 'Statement of Cash Flows' (SFAS 95).

     Under FRS1 cash flows are  presented  for (i)  operating  activities;  (ii)
dividends from joint ventures;  (iii)  dividends from  associated  undertakings;
(iv) servicing of finance and returns on investments; (v) taxation; (vi) capital
expenditure and financial investment;  (vii) acquisitions and disposals;  (viii)
dividends;  (ix) management of liquid resources; and (x) financing. SFAS 95 only
requires  presentation  of cash flows from  operating,  investing  and financing
activities.

     Cash  flows  under FRS1 in respect of  dividends  from joint  ventures  and
associated  undertakings,  taxation  and  servicing  of finance  and  returns on
investments are included  within  operating  activities  under SFAS 95. Interest
paid includes payments in respect of capitalized  interest,  which under SFAS 95
are included in capital expenditure under investing activities. Cash flows under
FRS1 in  respect of capital  expenditure  and  acquisitions  and  disposals  are
included in  investing  activities  under SFAS 95.  Dividends  paid are included
within financing activities.  All short-term  investments are regarded as liquid
resources  for  FRS1.  Under  SFAS  95  short-term   investments  with  original
maturities  of three  months  or less are  classified  as cash  equivalents  and
aggregated  with cash in the cash  flow  statement.  Cash  flows in  respect  of
short-term  investments  with  original  maturities  exceeding  three months are
included in operating activities.

NOTE 44-- US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (CONCLUDED)

IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:  In June 1998, the Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued  Statement  of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 133 `Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities
(`SFAS 133').  The effective  date of this standard was delayed for one year, to
accounting  periods  beginning  after June 15,  2000,  by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.137,  `Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities  - Deferral  of the  Effective  Date of FASB  Statement  No. 133 - an
amendment of FASB Statement No.133', issued in June 1999. SFAS 133 requires that
all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of  derivatives  are  recorded  each period in current
earnings or other  comprehensive  income,  depending on whether a derivative  is
designated  as part of a hedge  transaction  and,  if it is,  the  type of hedge
transaction.  The Company has not yet completed its  evaluation of the impact of
adopting SFAS 133 on the Group's results of operations and financial position as
adjusted to accord with US GAAP.

     START-UP  COSTS:  Effective  January 1, 1999 the Group adopted the American
Institute  of Certified  Public  Accountants'  issued  Statement of Position No.
98-5, `Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities' (SOP 98-5). This Statement
requires costs  associated with start-up  activities and  organization  costs be
expensed as incurred.  Under its previous practice, the Group generally expensed
such costs as  incurred.  The  adoption of SOP 98-5 had no impact on the Group's
results of  operations  and  financial  positions  as adjusted to accord with US
GAAP.

NOTE 45 -- BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS

     BP Amoco  has  three  reportable  operating  segments  --  Exploration  and
Production,  Refining and Marketing and Chemicals.  Exploration and Production's
activities  include oil and natural gas  exploration  and field  development and
production (upstream activities), together with pipeline transportation, natural
gas processing and natural gas marketing (midstream activities).  The activities
of Refining and Marketing include oil supply and trading as well as refining and
marketing (downstream  activities).  Chemicals activities include petrochemicals
manufacturing and marketing.

     The  Group  is  managed  on  a  unified  basis.   Reportable  segments  are
differentiated  by the  activities  that each  undertakes  and the products they
manufacture and market.

     The  accounting  policies  of  operating  segments  are the  same as  those
described in Note 1,  Accounting  Policies.  Performance  is evaluated  based on
replacement  cost operating profit or loss,  which excludes  exceptional  items,

STANDARDIZED  MEASURE OF  DISCOUNTED  FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES  THEREIN
RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

     The following tables set out the standardized measures of discounted future
net cash  flows,  and  changes  therein,  relating  to crude oil and natural gas
production  from the Group's  estimated  proved  reserves.  This  information is
prepared in  compliance  with the  requirements  of FASB  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  69 --  'Disclosures  about  Oil  and  Gas  Producing
Activities'.

     Future  net  cash  flows  have  been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  certain
assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future
production,  the  estimation  of crude  oil and  natural  gas  reserves  and the
application  of year end crude oil and  natural gas prices and  exchange  rates.
Furthermore,  both reserve  estimates  and  production  forecasts are subject to
revision  as  further  technical  information  becomes  available  and  economic
conditions  change.  BP  Amoco  cautions  against  relying  on  the  information
presented  because of the highly  arbitrary nature of assumptions on which it is
based  and its  lack of  comparability  with  the  historical  cost  information
presented in the financial statements.

(a)  Future cash inflows are  computed by applying  year-end oil and natural gas
     prices and exchange rates to future annual  production  levels estimated by
     the Group's petroleum engineers.

(b)  Production  costs  (which  include  petroleum  revenue  tax in the  UK) and
     development  costs  relating to future  production  of proved  reserves are
     based on year-end cost levels and assume  continuation of existing economic
     conditions. Future decommissioning costs are included.

(c)  Taxation is computed using appropriate year-end income tax rates.

(d)  Future net cash flows from oil and natural gas production are discounted at
     10%  regardless  of the Group  assessment of the risk  associated  with its
     producing activities.

(e)  Net changes in prices and production  costs includes the effect of exchange
     movements.

ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS

     In  addition,  at December 31, 1999 the Group's  share of the  standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows of associated  undertakings amounted
to $2,420  million  ($715  million  at  December  31,  1998 and $830  million at
December 31, 1997).

PRODUCTIVE OIL AND GAS WELLS AND ACREAGE

      The following  tables show the number of gross and net  productive oil and
natural  gas wells and total gross and net  developed  and  undeveloped  oil and
natural  gas  acreage  in which the Group and its  associated  undertakings  had
interests  as of December  31,  1999.  A 'gross'  well or acre is one in which a
whole or fractional  working interest is owned,  while the number of 'net' wells
or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional  working interests in gross wells
or acres.  Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed  acreage is the  acreage  within  the  boundary  of a field,  on which
development  wells have been drilled,  which could  produce the reserves;  while
undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to
a point that would permit the  production of commercial  quantities,  whether or
not such acres contain proved reserves.

NET OIL AND GAS WELLS COMPLETED OR ABANDONED

     The following  table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory
and  development  oil and natural gas wells  completed or abandoned in the years
indicated by the Group and its associated undertakings. Productive wells include
wells in which  hydrocarbons  were encountered and the drilling or completion of
which,  in the case of exploratory  wells,  has been suspended  pending  further
drilling or  evaluation.  A dry well is one found to be  incapable  of producing
hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.

SCHEDULE

1    In Article 2 there  shall be  inserted  immediately  after the  definition
of "debenture" the following new paragraphs:

"The  expression  "Designated  Shares"  shall mean  fully paid  shares in a body
corporate  (which both immediately  before and after the distribution  hereafter
referred to is a subsidiary of the Company)  which have been  distributed by the
Company  pursuant to Article 123 and which, at or before the record date for the
purpose  of  determining  entitlement  to  receipt  of  such  distribution,  are
designated  by the  Directors  to be  "Designated  Shares"  for the  purposes of
Article 37(A) and any further shares of the same class which may, with the prior
consent  of  the  Company,  be  allotted  by  such  body  corporate  after  such
distribution,   provided   that  the  Directors  may  at  any  time  after  such
distribution  declare  such shares no longer to be  "Designated  Shares" for the
purposes of such Article by giving not less than 15 days prior notice thereof to
The Stock  Exchange,  and  provided  further that there shall not at any time be
more than one class of shares constituting Designated Shares."

"The expression  "Designated  Subsidiary" shall mean the body corporate referred
to in the definition of "Designated Shares"."

2     In Article 37(A) the first sentence shall be deleted and replaced by the
following:

"The Directors may, in their absolute  discretion and without giving any reason,
refuse to  register  the  transfer  of a share which is not fully paid and shall
(for so long as there is in issue any Designated  Share) decline to register the
transfer of any Ordinary  Share unless there is produced to the  Directors  such
evidence  as they may in their  discretion  require  to ensure  that on the same
occasion there is being  transferred to the same person one Designated Share for
every Ordinary Share included in such transfer. For so long as there is in issue
any  Designated  Share,  every  transfer of one or more  Ordinary  Shares shall,
except so far as otherwise  stated on the  instrument of transfer,  constitute a
transfer of the same number of Designated Shares."

3     In Article 115 the words "declare and" in the penultimate line shall be
deleted.

4     In Article 123:

     (a)  The following new sentences shall be added after the first sentence:

"In addition  the  Directors  may direct  payment of any dividend in whole or in
part by the distribution of Designated  Shares.  If at any time and from time to
time there have  been,  or will be,  allotted  any shares  which are  Designated
Shares,  and the  Directors  resolve to allot to any person any Ordinary  Shares
(whether or not pursuant to an existing obligation of the Company) the Directors
may, if and so far as in the opinion of the Directors the profits of the Company
justify  such  payments,  either  at the time of such  allotment  or at any time
thereafter, resolve that there be paid to the registered holder of such Ordinary
Shares as at the close of business (or at such other time as the  Directors  may
determine)  on such date as the  Directors  may specify a dividend to be paid by
the  distribution of Designated  Shares in such amount and manner as will secure
that such holder will receive one Designated  Share for each Ordinary Share held
by him. (If and so far as the foregoing  provisions are inconsistent  with those
contained  in Articles  115,  116, 124 or 126, the  foregoing  provisions  shall
prevail.)"

     (b)  There shall be added as a new  sentence at the end of such Article the
          following:

"The  Directors may in relation to any such  distribution  of Designated  Shares
authorise  any person to enter on behalf of all the members  interested  into an
agreement with the relevant Designated  Subsidiary whereby such members agree to
become  members  and to be bound,  in respect of their  holdings  of  Designated
Shares from time to time,  by the  Memorandum  and Articles of  Association  (as
amended from time to time),  of such  Designated  Subsidiary  and each mandateor
other   instruction   relating  to  the  payment  of   dividends  or  making  of
distributions  by the Company,  and which is in force at the time of determining
entitlement to any distribution of Designated  Shares,  shall,  unless and until
revoked,  become  a valid  and  binding  mandate  or other  instruction  to such
Designated  Subsidiary in respect of any dividend or other  distribution paid or
made by it, and any agreement  made under the  authority  given to the Directors
pursuant to this Article shall be effective and binding on all concerned."

of the Act and is in  default  for the  Prescribed  Period in  supplying  to the
Company  the  information  thereby  required,  then the  Directors  may in their
absolute  discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a "Direction  Notice") to
such  member  direct  that in  respect of the  shares in  relation  to which the
default  occurred (the "Default  Shares")  (which  expression  shall include any
further  shares which are issued in respect of such shares) the member shall not
be entitled to vote either  personally  or by proxy at a General  Meeting of the
Company or a meeting of the  holders of any class of shares of the Company or to
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to General Meetings
of the Company or meetings of the holders of any class of shares of the Company.

                                       20
<PAGE>
      (B) The Company shall send to each other person appearing to be interested
in the shares the subject of any Direction Notice a copy of the said Notice, but
the  failure  or  omission  by the  Company to do so shall not  invalidate  such
Direction Notice.

      (C) Where the Default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. of the
issued shares of that class then the Direction Notice may additionally direct:-

      (i) that any cash dividend or other money which would otherwise be payable
in respect of each of the Default Shares shall (in whole or any part thereof) be
retained by the Company without any liability to pay interest  thereon when such
money is finally paid to the member; and/or

      (ii)  that no transfer of any of the shares held by such member shall be
registered unless:-

(a)  the member is not himself in default as regards  supplying the  information
     required and the transfer is of part only of the member's  holding and when
     presented for registration is accompanied by a certificate by the member in
     a form  satisfactory  to the  Directors  to the  effect  that after due and
     careful  enquiry  the  member is  satisfied  that no person in  default  as
     regards  supplying such  information is interested in any of the shares the
     subject of the transfer; or

(b)  the transfer is an approved transfer.

      (D) Where any person  appearing to be interested in the Default Shares has
been duly served with a Direction  Notice and the Default  Shares  which are the
subject  of such  Direction  Notice  are  held by an  Approved  Depositary,  the
provisions  of this  Article  shall be treated as applying  only to such Default
Shares  held by the  Approved  Depositary  and  not  (insofar  as such  person's
apparent  interest  is  concerned)  to any  other  shares  held by the  Approved
Depositary.

served is an Approved Depositary acting in its capacity as such, the obligations
of the  Approved  Depositary  as a member of the  Company  shall be  limited  to
disclosing to the Company such  information  relating to any person appearing to
be  interested  in the shares held by it as has been  recorded by it pursuant to
the  arrangements  entered  into by the  Company or  approved  by the  Directors
pursuant to which it was appointed as an Approved Depositary.

      (F) Any Direction  Notice shall have effect in accordance  with its terms
for so long as the  default  in  respect  of which  the  Direction  Notice  was
issued continues and (unless the  Directors  otherwise  determine)  for a period
of one week thereafter but shall cease to have effect in relation to any Default
Shares which are  transferred  by such  member by means of an  approved
transfer.  The Directors may at any time give notice cancelling a Default
Notice.

      (G) For the purpose of this Article:-

      (i) a person shall be treated as appearing to be  interested in any shares
if the member holding such shares has given to the Company a notification  under
the said  Section 212 of the Act which  either (a) names such person as being so
interested or (b) fails to establish the  identities of those  interested in the
shares  and (after  taking  into  account  the said  notification  and any other
relevant Section 212  notification) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to
believe or suspects on reasonable  grounds that the person in question is or may
be interested in the shares;

      (ii) the  Prescribed  Period  is 28 days from the date of  service  of the
notice under the said Section 212 except that if the Default Shares represent at
least 0.25 per cent. of the issued shares of that class,  the Prescribed  Period
is 14 days from such date; and

      (iii) a transfer of shares is an approved transfer if but only if:-

     (a)  it is a transfer  of shares to an offeror  by way or in  pursuance  of
          acceptance  of a take-over  offer for a company (as defined in Section
          14 of the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985); or

     (b)  the Directors  are  satisfied  that the transfer is made pursuant to a
          sale of the whole of the beneficial ownership of the shares to a party
          unconnected  with the member and with other  persons  appearing  to be
          interested in such shares; or

     (c)  the transfer results from a sale made through a recognised  investment
          exchange as defined in the  Financial  Services  Act 1986 or any other
          stock  exchange  outside  the United  Kingdom  on which the  Company's
          shares are normally traded.

      (H)  Nothing  contained  in this  Article  shall  limit  the  power of the
Directors under Section 216 of the Act."

inserted as a new Article 91(B) the following:-

such  provisions  as they think fit for any  fractional  entitlements  including
provisions  whereby,  in whole or in part,  the benefit  thereof  accrues to the
Company and/or under which  fractional  entitlements are accrued and/or retained

dividend,  the rate of exchange  to be used to  determine  the foreign  currency

Company held on 30th April,  1987,  and shall lapse if not exercised  before the

as set out in Schedule I to the letter  from The  Chairman to the members of the

persons) as it thinks fit to act as its representative  (or, as the case may be,
representatives) at any meeting of the Company or of any class of members of the
Company. A person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on
behalf of the grantor of the  authority  (in respect of those shares held in the
name of the grantor in respect of which his  authorisation is given, in the case
of any authorisation by an Approved Depositary) as the grantor could exercise if
it were an  individual  member of the  Company,  and each  person so  authorised
shall,  if present at any such  meeting,  for the purposes of these  Articles be
deemed to be a member present in person at such meeting."

That the  Articles of  Association  of the Company be amended by  inserting  the
following Article as Article 11(C):

"11(C) (i) The Directors may with the prior  sanction of an Ordinary  Resolution
of the  Company  implement  and  maintain  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and
conditions of such  Resolution but otherwise as the Directors may determine from
time to time a share dividend or distribution  reinvestment plan for the benefit
of the holders of Ordinary  Shares of the Company  whereby  such  holders may be
given one or more of the following options namely:-

      (a)  instead of taking  the net cash  amount due to them in respect of any
dividend (or any part thereof) declared or payable on all or any Ordinary Shares
held by them either to invest such cash in  subscribing  for  unissued  Ordinary
Shares in the capital of the  Company  payable in full or by  instalments  or in
paying up in full or by  instalments  any unpaid or partly paid Ordinary  Shares
held by them on the terms of any such plan; or

      (b)  instead of taking  the net cash  amount due to them in respect of any
dividend (or any part thereof) declared or payable on all or any Ordinary Shares
held by them to elect to  receive  new  Ordinary  Shares in the  capital  of the
Company credited as fully paid on the terms and conditions of any such plan; or

      (c) to forego their  entitlement  to any  dividend  (or any part  thereof)
declared  or  payable  on all or any  Ordinary  Shares  held by them and to take
instead fully paid bonus Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions of any such
plan; or

      (d) any other  option in respect of the whole or any part of any  dividend
on all or any Ordinary Shares held by them as the Directors shall determine.

      (ii) The Directors may in their  discretion  suspend or terminate any such
plan which is in operation.

      (iii) For the purpose of any such plan the Directors may capitalise out of
such of the sums standing to the credit of any of the Company's reserve accounts
(including any share premium account,  capital  redemption  reserve or any other
undistributable  reserve) or any of the profits available for distribution under
the  provisions of the Statutes and which could  otherwise  have been applied in
paying  dividends in cash as the  Directors  may  determine,  a sum equal to the
aggregate  nominal  amount of any Ordinary  Shares to be allotted under any such
plan and shall  apply the same in  paying up in full the  appropriate  number of
unissued  Ordinary Shares for allotment and distribution  credited as fully paid
up to and  amongst  the holders of  Ordinary  Shares  entitled to the same.  The
Directors may do all acts and things  considered  necessary or expedient to give
effect to any such  capitalisation and may authorise any person on behalf of all
the holders of Ordinary  Shares  entitled to the same to enter into an agreement
with the Company providing for any such  capitalisation  and matters  incidental
thereto and any  agreement  made under such  authority  shall be  effective  and
binding on all concerned.

      (iv) No fraction of any share shall be allotted.  The  Directors  may make
such  provisions  as they  think fit for any  fractional  entitlement  including
provisions  whereby,  in whole or in part,  the benefit  thereof  accrues to the
Company.

      (v) The Directors shall notify the holders of Ordinary Shares of the terms
and  conditions  of any such plan and shall  make  available  or provide to them
forms of election so that they may exercise the rights granted.

      (vi) The power  conferred under this Article and by any authority given by
the Shareholders shall not be exercised unless the Company shall then have:

      (a)   sufficient unissued shares in the capital of the Company capable of
being issued as Ordinary Shares; and

      (b) if any  shares  are to be  allotted  other  than for cash,  sufficient
profits  available  for  distribution  or reserves  standing to the credit of an
appropriate account to give effect to the terms of any such plan.

      (vii) The Directors may in their discretion on any occasion determine that
any such plan shall not be made  available  to  Ordinary  Shareholders  resident
within or beyond specified territories or jurisdictions."

meeting of such  holders,  consent on behalf of all the holders of shares of the
class to the issue or  creation  of any shares  ranking  equally  therewith,  or
having any priority thereto, or to the abandonment of any preference or priority
or of any accrued dividend,  or the reduction for any time or permanently of the
dividends  payable thereon,  or to the amalgamation into one class of the shares
of any two or more  classes or to the  sub-division  of shares of one class into
shares of different  classes,  or any  alteration in these  presents  varying or
taking away any rights or privileges  attached to shares of the class, or to any
scheme for the reduction of the Company's  capital affecting the class of shares
in a manner not otherwise authorised by these presents, or to any scheme for the
distribution  (though not in accordance with legal rights) of assets in money or
in kind in or before  liquidation,  or to any contract for the sale of the whole
or any part of the Company's  property or business  determining the way in which
as between the several classes of shareholders the purchase  consideration shall
be distributed, and generally consent to any alteration, contract, compromise or
arrangement  which the persons voting thereon could if sui juris and holding all
the shares of the class consent to or enter into, and such  Resolution  shall be
binding upon all the holders of shares of the class.

and  conducted  in all  respects  as  nearly as  possible  in the same way as an
Extraordinary  General Meeting of the Company provided that no member, not being
a Director,  shall be entitled to notice thereof or to attend thereat, unless he
be a holder of shares of the class  intended to be  affected by the  Resolution,
and that no vote shall be given except in respect of a share of that class,  and
that the quorum at any such meeting  shall  (subject to the  provisions as to an
adjourned meeting  hereinafter  contained) by persons holding or representing by
proxy  one-tenth  of the  issued  shares  of that  class (as  regards  the First
Preference Shares and the Second Preference  Shares) and one-third of the issued

such  meeting a poll may be  demanded  in writing by not less than five  members
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote.

ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL

6 The Company may from time to time by Ordinary  Resolution increase its capital
by such sum to be divided  into shares of such amounts as the  Resolution  shall
prescribe. All new shares shall be subject to the provisions of the Statutes and
of these presents with reference to allotment, payment of calls, lien, transfer,
transmission, forfeiture and otherwise.

7     (A)   The Company may by Ordinary Resolution:-

      (i)   consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares
of larger amount than its existing shares;

      (ii)  cancel  any  shares  which,  at  the  date  of  the  passing  of the
Resolution,  have not been  taken,  or  agreed to be taken,  by any  person  and
diminish the amount of its capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled;

      (iii) sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount
than is fixed by the Memorandum of Association  (subject,  nevertheless,  to the
provisions of the  Statutes),  and so that the  Resolution  whereby any share is
sub-divided may determine  that, as between the holders of the shares  resulting
from such  sub-division,  one or more of the shares may,  as  compared  with the
others, have any such preferred, deferred or other special rights, or be subject
to any such restrictions,  as the Company has power to attach to unissued or new
shares.

      (B) Whenever as a result of a  consolidation  and division or sub-division
of shares any  difficulty  arises,  the  Directors  may settle the matter in any
manner they deem fit, and, in particular, may sell shares representing fractions
to which any members would become entitled to any person (including,  subject to
the provisions of the Statutes,  the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of
sale in due proportion among those members, and the Directors may authorise some
person to execute an  instrument  of transfer of the shares to, or in accordance
with the directions of, the purchaser.  The transferee shall not be bound to see
to the  application  of the purchase  money nor shall his title to the shares be
affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings relating to the
sale.

8     Subject to the provisions of the Statutes the Company may purchase any of
its own shares (including any redeemable shares).

9 The Company may reduce its share  capital or any capital  redemption  reserve,
share premium  account or other  undistributable  reserve in any manner and with
and subject to any incident authorised and consent required by law.

SHARES

10 Without prejudice to any special rights  previously  conferred on the holders
of any  shares or class of shares for the time  being  issued,  any share in the
Company may be issued with such preferred,  deferred or other special rights, or
subject to such  restrictions,  whether as regards dividend,  return of capital,
voting or otherwise, as the Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution
determine  (or, in the absence of any such  determination,  as the Directors may
determine)  and subject to the  provisions of the Statutes the Company may issue
any shares  which are, or at the option of the Company or the holder are liable,
to be redeemed.

11 (A)  Subject  to  the  provisions  of the  Statutes  relating  to  authority,
pre-emption rights and otherwise and of any Resolution of the Company in General
Meeting passed pursuant thereto, all unissued shares shall be at the disposal of
the  Directors  and  they  may  allot  (with or  without  conferring  a right of
renunciation),  grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons,
at such times and on such terms as they think proper.

      (B) (i)  Pursuant  to and in  accordance  with  Section  80 of the Act the
Directors shall be generally and unconditionally authorised to exercise for each
prescribed period all the powers of the Company to allot relevant  securities up
to an aggregate nominal amount equal to the Section 80 Amount; and

      (ii) pursuant to and within the terms of the said  authority the Directors
shall be empowered  during each  prescribed  period to allot  equity  securities
wholly for cash (a) in connection with a rights issue; and (b) otherwise than in
connection  with a rights issue up to an aggregate  nominal  amount equal to the
Section 89 Amount; and

                                       40
<PAGE>
      (iii) during each prescribed  period the Company and its Directors by such
authority and power may make offers or  agreements  which would or might require
equity  securities or other relevant  securities to be allotted after the expiry
of such period; and

      (iv)  for the purposes of this Article 11(B):-

      (a) "rights issue" means an offer of equity securities open for acceptance
for a period  fixed by the  Directors  to  holders of equity  securities  on the
register on a fixed record date in  proportion to their  respective  holdings of
such securities or in accordance with the rights attached thereto but subject to
such  exclusions or other  arrangements  as the Directors may deem  necessary or
expedient in relation to fractional  entitlements or legal or practical problems
under the laws of, or the requirements of any recognised  regulatory body or any
stock  exchange  in, any  territory  or as regards  shares  held by an  Approved
Depositary;

      (b)  "prescribed  period"  means any period (not  exceeding 5 years on any
occasion) for which the authority  conferred in the case of sub-paragraph (i) is
renewed by Ordinary or Special Resolution stating the Section 80 Amount, and the
power  conferred  in the  case of  sub-paragraph  (ii)  is  renewed  by  Special
Resolution stating the Section 89 amount;

      (c)   "the Section 80 Amount" shall for any prescribed period be
that stated in the relevant Ordinary or Special Resolution;

      (d)   "the Section 89 Amount" shall for any prescribed period by that
stated in the relevant Special Resolution;

      (e) the nominal amount of any securities shall be taken to be, in the case
of rights to  subscribe  for or to convert  any  securities  into  shares of the
Company,  the nominal  amount of such shares  which may be allotted  pursuant to
such rights; and

      (f) words and expressions defined in or for the purposes of Part IV of the
Act shall bear the same meanings herein.

      (C)  (i)  The  Directors  may  with  the  prior  sanction  of an  Ordinary
Resolution of the Company  implement  and maintain in accordance  with the terms
and  conditions of such  Resolution but otherwise as the Directors may determine
from time to time a share dividend or  distribution  reinvestment  plan or plans
for the benefit of the holders of Ordinary  Shares of the Company  whereby  such
holders may be given one or more of the following options namely:

      (a)  instead of taking  the net cash  amount due to them in respect of any
dividend (or any part thereof) declared or payable on all or any Ordinary Shares
held by them either to invest such cash in  subscribing  for  unissued  Ordinary
Shares in the capital of the  Company  payable in full or by  instalments  or in
paying up in full or by  instalments  any unpaid or partly paid Ordinary  Shares
held by them on the terms of any such plan; or

      (b)  instead of taking  the net cash  amount due to them in respect of any
dividend (or any part thereof) declared or payable on all or any Ordinary Shares
held by them to elect to  receive  new  Ordinary  Shares in the  capital  of the
Company credited as fully paid on the terms and conditions of any such plan; or

      (c) to forego their  entitlement  to any  dividend  (or any part  thereof)
declared  or  payable  on all or any  Ordinary  Shares  held by them and to take
instead fully paid bonus Ordinary Shares on the terms and conditions of any such
plan; or

      (d) any other  option in respect of the whole or any part of any  dividend
on all or any Ordinary Shares held by them as the Directors shall determine.

      Where in the case of any plan such as those contemplated in paragraphs (b)
and (c) above,  holders of Ordinary Shares are not entitled to payment of a cash
dividend  (otherwise than in respect of fractional  entitlements),  the plan may
provide for them to receive allotments of Ordinary Shares credited as fully paid
having a value of more than the net cash amount which would  otherwise be due to
them in respect of the relevant dividend but not exceeding a value equivalent to
the sum of the net cash amount of the dividend  together with the associated tax
credit (as defined in sub-paragraph (viii) below).

      (ii) The Directors may in their discretion  suspend or terminate or modify
in any manner not inconsistent with these presents or the sanctioning Resolution
any such plan which is in operation.

      (iii) For the purposes of any such plan the Directors may  capitalise  out
of such of the sums  standing  to the  credit  of any of the  Company's  reserve
accounts (including any share premium account, capital redemption reserve or any
other undistributable  reserve) or any of the profits available for distribution
under the provisions of the Statutes and which could otherwise have been applied
in paying  dividends in cash as the Directors may determine,  a sum equal to the
aggregate  nominal  amount of any Ordinary  Shares to be allotted under any such
plan and shall  apply the same in  paying up in full the  appropriate  number of
unissued  Ordinary Shares for allotment and distribution  credited as fully paid
up to and  amongst  the holders of  Ordinary  Shares  entitled to the same.  The
Directors may do all acts and things  considered  necessary or expedient to give
effect to any such  capitalisation and may authorise any person on behalf of all
the holders of Ordinary  Shares  entitled to the same to enter into an agreement
with the Company providing for any such  capitalisation  and matters  incidental
thereto and any  agreement  made under such  authority  shall be  effective  and
binding on all concerned.

                                       41
<PAGE>
      (iv) No fraction of any share shall be allotted.  The  Directors  may make
such  provisions  as they think fit for any  fractional  entitlements  including
provisions  whereby,  in whole or in part,  the benefit  thereof  accrues to the
Company and/or under which  fractional  entitlements are accrued and/or retained
and in each case  accumulated on behalf of any  shareholder and such accruals or
retentions  are applied to the allotment (by reference to the aggregate net cash
amount  thereof or value  equivalent to the sum of the aggregate net cash amount
thereof together with the associated tax credit which it would have attracted if
paid as a dividend)  by way of bonus to or cash  subscription  on behalf of such
shareholder of fully paid Ordinary Shares.

      (v) The Directors shall notify the holders of Ordinary Shares of the terms
and  conditions  of any such plan and shall  make  available  or provide to them
forms of election so that they may exercise the rights granted.

      (vi) The power  conferred under this Article and by any authority given by
the Shareholders shall not be exercised unless the Company shall then have:-

      (a)   sufficient unissued shares in the capital of the Company capable of
being issued as Ordinary Shares; and

      (b) if any  shares  are to be  allotted  other  than for cash,  sufficient
profits  available  for  distribution  or reserves  standing to the credit of an
appropriate account to give effect to the terms of any such plan.

      (vii) The Directors may in their discretion on any occasion determine that
any such plan shall not be made  available  to  Ordinary  Shareholders  resident
within or  beyond  specified  territories  or  jurisdictions  or in  respect  of
Ordinary Shares held by an Approved  Depositary or in respect of Ordinary Shares
the  dividends on which are payable or liable to be payable in a currency  other
than US dollars or sterling pursuant to provision made under these presents.

      (viii)  "Associated tax credit" means for the purposes of this Article and
any plan the tax credit which would be available to the  recipient of a dividend
under Section 231 of the Income and Taxes Act 1988 on the  assumption  that such
recipient is an individual resident in the UK for UK taxation purposes.

12 The Company may  exercise the powers of paying  commissions  conferred by the
Statutes to the full extent thereby permitted. The Company may also on any issue
of shares pay such brokerage as may be lawful.

13 The Directors may at any time after the allotment of any share but before any
person has been  entered in the  Register  of Members as the holder  recognise a
renunciation  thereof by the  allottee  in favour of some  other  person and may
accord to any allottee of a share a right to effect such  renunciation  upon and
subject to such terms and conditions as the Directors may think fit to impose.

14 Except as required by law, no person  shall be  recognised  by the Company as
holding  any share  upon any  trust,  and the  Company  shall not be bound by or
compelled in any way to recognise any equitable,  contingent,  future or partial
interest in any share,  or any interest in any  fractional  part of a share,  or
(except only as by these presents or by law otherwise  provided) any other right
in respect of any share, except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the
registered holder.

SHARE CERTIFICATES

15 Every  share  certificate  shall be executed by the Company in such manner as
the  Directors  may  decide,  which  may  include  the  use of the  Seal  or the
Securities  Seal (or,  in the case of shares on a branch  register,  an official
seal  for  use in the  relevant  territory).  No  certificate  shall  be  issued
representing  shares of more than one class.  No  certificate  shall normally be
issued in respect of shares held by a Stock Exchange Nominee.

16 In the case of a share held jointly by several  persons the Company shall not
be  bound  to issue  more  than  one  certificate  therefor  and  delivery  of a
certificate to one of the joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all.

17 Any person  (subject as  aforesaid)  whose name is entered in the Register of
Members in  respect  of any  shares of any one class upon the issue or  transfer
thereof shall  (subject,  in the case of issue, to the terms of the issue of any
such shares) be entitled without payment to a certificate  therefor (in the case
of issue)  within one month (or such  longer  period as the terms of issue shall
provide)  after  allotment  or (in the case of a transfer of fully paid  shares)
within  fourteen days after lodgment of a transfer or (in the case of a transfer
of partly paid shares) within two months after lodgment of a transfer.

18  Where  some  only  of  the  shares  comprised  in a  share  certificate  are
transferred the old certificate shall be cancelled and a new certificate for the
balance of such shares issued in lieu without charge.

                                       42
<PAGE>

19    (A) Any two or more certificates representing shares of any one class held
by any member may at his request be cancelled and a single new certificate for
such shares issued in lieu without charge.

      (B) If any member shall  surrender for  cancellation  a share  certificate
representing  shares  held by him and request the Company to issue in lieu share
certificates representing such shares in such proportions as he may specify, the
Directors may, if they think fit, comply with such request.

      (C) If a share  certificate shall be damaged or defaced or alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed,  a new certificate  representing the same shares
may be issued to the  holder  upon  request  subject to  delivery  up of the old
certificate  or (if alleged to have been lost,  stolen or destroyed)  compliance
with  such   conditions  as  to  evidence  and  indemnity  and  the  payment  of
out-of-pocket  expenses  of the  Company in  connection  with the request as the
Directors may think fit.

      (D) In the case of shares held jointly by several persons any such request
may be made by any one of the joint holders.

CALLS ON SHARES

20 The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of
any moneys  unpaid on their shares  (whether on account of the nominal  value of
the shares,  or when  permitted,  by way of premium)  but subject  always to the
terms of issue of such  shares.  A call shall be deemed to have been made at the
time when the  Resolution of the Directors  authorising  the call was passed and
may be made payable by instalments.

21 Each member  shall  (subject to  receiving  at least  fourteen  days'  notice
specifying  the time or times and place of  payment)  pay to the  Company at the
time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares.  The joint
holders of a share  shall be jointly  and  severally  liable to pay all calls in
respect  thereof.  A call may be  revoked  or  postponed  as the  Directors  may
determine.

22 If a sum  called  in  respect  of a share  is not paid  before  or on the day
appointed  for  payment  thereof,  the person from whom the sum is due shall pay
interest on the sum from the day  appointed  for payment  thereof to the time of
actual  payment  at such rate (not  exceeding  15 per  cent.  per  annum) as the
Directors may  determine  but the  Directors  shall be at liberty in any case or
cases to waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.

23 Any sum  (whether on account of the  nominal  value of the share or by way of
premium)  which by the terms of issue of a share becomes  payable upon allotment
or at any fixed date shall for all the  purposes of these  presents be deemed to
be a call  duly made and  payable  on the date on which by the term of issue the
same becomes  payable.  In case of  non-payment  all the relevant  provisions of
these  presents as to payment of interest and expenses,  forfeiture or otherwise
shall apply as if such sum had become  payable by virtue of a call duly made and
notified.

24 The Directors may on the issue of shares differentiate between the holders as
to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.

25 (A) The  Directors  may if they think fit receive from any member  willing to
advance  the same all or any  part of the  moneys  (whether  on  account  of the
nominal  value of the shares or by way of premium)  uncalled and unpaid upon the
shares  held by him and such  payment in advance of calls shall  extinguish  pro
tanto the liability  upon the shares in respect of which it is made and upon the
money so  received  (until  and to the  extent  that the same would but for such
advance become payable) the Company may pay interest at such rate (not exceeding
12 per cent.  per annum) as the member  paying  such sum and the  Directors  may
agree.

      (B)  Whenever  any law for the time being of any  country,  state or place
imposes or purports to impose any immediate or future or possible liability upon
the Company to make any payment or empowers any  government or taxing  authority
or government  official to require the Company to make any payment in respect of
any shares  registered in any of the Company's  registers as held either jointly
or solely by any member or in respect of any dividends,  bonuses or other moneys
due or payable or accruing due or which may become due or payable to such member
by the Company on or in respect of any shares  registered as aforesaid or for or
on account or in respect of any member and whether in consequence of:-

      (i)   the death of such member;

      (ii)  the non-payment of any income tax or other tax by such member;

      (iii) the non-payment of any estate, probate, succession, death, stamp, or
other duty by the executor or  administrator  of such member or by or out of his
estate; or

      (iv)  any other act or thing; the Company in every such case:-

                                       43
<PAGE>
      (a)   shall be fully indemnified by such member or his executor or
administrator from all liability; and

      (b) may  recover  as a debt  due  from  such  member  or his  executor  or
administrator  wherever  constituted  or residing any monies paid by the Company
under or in  consequence  of any such law together with interest  thereon at the
rate  of 15 per  cent.  per  annum  thereon  from  date  of  payment  to date of
repayment.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  prejudice  or affect any right or
remedy  which any law may  confer or  purport  to confer on the  Company  and as
between  the  Company  and  every  such  member  as  aforesaid,   his  executor,
administrator,  and estate  wheresoever  constituted  or  situate,  any right or
remedy which such law shall confer or purport to confer on the Company  shall be
enforceable by the Company.

FORFEITURE AND LIEN

26 If a member fails to pay in full any call or  instalment of a call on the due
date for payment  thereof,  the  Directors  may at any time  thereafter  serve a
notice  on him  requiring  payment  of so much of the call or  instalment  as is
unpaid  together  with any  interest  which  may have  accrued  thereon  and any
expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment.

27 The notice  shall name a further day (not being less than seven days from the
date of  service  of the  notice)  on or before  which  and the place  where the
payment  required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event
of  non-payment  in  accordance  therewith the shares on which the call has been
made will be liable to be forfeited.

28 If the  requirements  of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied  with,
any  share in  respect  of which  such  notice  has been  given  may at any time
thereafter, before payment of all calls and interest and expenses due in respect
thereof has been made,  be forfeited by a  Resolution  of the  Directors to that
effect.  Such forfeiture shall include all dividends  declared in respect of the
forfeited  share and not actually  paid before  forfeiture.  The  Directors  may
accept a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder.

29 A share so forfeited or surrendered  shall become the property of the Company
and may be sold,  re-allotted or otherwise  disposed of either to the person who
was before such  forfeiture or surrender the holder thereof or entitled  thereto
or to any other person upon such terms and in such manner as the Directors shall
think  fit and at any  time  before  a sale,  re-allotment  or  disposition  the
forfeiture or surrender  may be cancelled on such terms as the  Directors  think
fit.  The  Directors  may,  if  necessary,  authorise  some person to transfer a
forfeited or surrendered share to any such other person as aforesaid.

30 A member whose shares have been forfeited or surrendered  shall cease to be a
member in  respect of the shares but shall  notwithstanding  the  forfeiture  or
surrender  remain  liable to pay to the Company all moneys  which at the date of
forfeiture or surrender were presently  payable by him to the Company in respect
of the shares  with  interest  thereon at 15 per cent.  Per annum (or such lower
rate as the  Directors may  determine)  from the date of forfeiture or surrender
until payment and the Directors may at their absolute discretion enforce payment
without any  allowance  for the value of the shares at the time of forfeiture or
surrender or waive payment in whole or in part.

31 The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a
fully paid share) for all moneys  (whether  presently  payable or not) called or
payable at a fixed time in respect of such share and the Company shall also have
a first  and  paramount  lien on every  share  (not  being a fully  paid  share)
standing  registered  in the  name of a  single  member  for all the  debts  and
liabilities  of such member or his estate to the Company  whether the same shall
have been  incurred  before or after  notice to the Company of any  equitable or
other  interest of any person  other than such member and whether the period for
the  payment or  discharge  of the same shall have  actually  arrived or not and
notwithstanding  that the same are joint debts or  liabilities of such member or
his estate and any other  person,  whether a member of the  Company or not.  The
Directors  may waive any lien which has arisen  and may  resolve  that any share
shall for some limited  period be exempt wholly or partially from the provisions
of this Article.

32 The Company may sell in such manner as the  Directors  think fit any share on
which the  Company  has a lien,  but no sale  shall be made  unless  some sum in
respect of which the lien exists is presently  payable nor until the  expiration
of 14 days after a notice in writing  stating and  demanding  payment of the sum
presently  payable and giving  notice of intention to sell in default shall have
been given to the holder for the time being of the share or the person  entitled
thereto by reason of the holder's death or bankruptcy.

33 The net  proceeds of such sale after  payment of the costs of such sale shall
be applied in or towards  payment or satisfaction of the debts or liabilities in
respect  whereof  the lien  exists so far as the same are then  payable  and any
residue  shall  (subject to a like lien for debts or  liabilities  not presently
payable  as  existed  upon the  shares  prior to the sale) be paid to the person
entitled to the shares at the time of the sale. For the purpose of giving effect
to any such sale the Directors may authorise  some person to transfer the shares
sold to the purchaser.

                                       44
<PAGE>
34 A statutory  declaration  in writing that the  declarant is a Director or the
Secretary of the Company and that a share has been duly forfeited or surrendered
or sold to  satisfy a lien of the  Company on a date  stated in the  declaration
shall be conclusive  evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons
claiming to be entitled to the share.  Such  declaration  and the receipt of the
Company  for the  consideration  (if  any)  given  for the  share  on the  sale,
re-allotment or disposal thereof together with the share  certificate  delivered
to a purchaser or allottee thereof shall (subject to the execution of a transfer
if the same be required)  constitute a good title to the share and the person to
whom the share is sold,  re-allotted  or disposed of shall be  registered as the
holder of the share  and  shall  not be bound to see to the  application  of the
purchase  money (if any) nor shall  his  title to the share be  affected  by any
irregularity  or  invalidity  in the  proceedings  relating  to the  forfeiture,
surrender, sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

35 All transfers of shares,  other than shares  represented by share warrants to
bearer, may be effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in
any other form  acceptable  to the  Directors  and may be under  hand only.  The
instrument  of transfer  shall be signed by or on behalf of the  transferor  and
(except in the case of fully paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The
transferor shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the
transferee is entered in the Register of Members in respect thereof.

36 The  registration  of  transfers  may be suspended at such times and for such
periods as the Directors may from time to time determine and either generally or
in respect of any class of shares.  The Register of Members  shall not be closed
for more than 30 days in any year.

37 (A) The Directors  may, in their  absolute  discretion and without giving any
reason,  refuse to register  the transfer of a share which is not fully paid and
shall  (for so long as  there is in  issue  any  Designated  Share)  decline  to
register  the  transfer of any  Ordinary  Share  unless there is produced to the
Directors such evidence as they may in their  discretion  require to ensure that
on the  same  occasion  there  is  being  transferred  to the  same  person  one
Designated Share for every Ordinary Share included in such transfer. For so long
as  there  is in issue  any  Designated  Share,  every  transfer  of one or more
Ordinary  Shares shall,  except so far as otherwise  stated on the instrument of
transfer, constitute a transfer of the same number of Designated Shares provided
that,  where any such  shares are  admitted to the  Official  List of the London
Stock Exchange, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent
dealings  in the shares of that class  from  taking  place on an open and proper
basis.  The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of shares  (whether
fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly.

      (B) If the  Directors  refuse to register a transfer they shall within two
months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company,  or ten
days after the Directors have  determined to refuse such transfer,  whichever is
the earlier, send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

38 The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer  unless the
instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share and is lodged at
the Transfer Office  accompanied by the relevant share  certificate(s)  and such
other evidence as the Directors may reasonably  require to show the right of the
transferor to make the transfer  (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed
by some other person on his behalf,  the  authority of that person so to do). In
the  case of a  transfer  by a Stock  Exchange  Nominee  the  lodgment  of share
certificates  will only be necessary if and to the extent that certificates have
been issued in respect of the shares in question.

39 All instruments of transfer which are registered may be retained by the
Company.

40 No fee will be charged by the Company in respect of the  registration  of any
instrument of transfer or probate or letters of administration or certificate of
marriage or death or stop notice or power of attorney  relating to or  affecting
the title to any shares.

41 The Company shall be entitled to destroy all  instruments  of transfer  which
have been registered at any time after the expiration of six years from the date
of registration thereof and all dividend mandates and notifications of change of
address at any time after the expiration of two years from the date of recording
thereof and all share  certificates  which have been cancelled at any time after
the  expiration  of one year from the date of the  cancellation  thereof  and it
shall  conclusively be presumed in favour of the Company that every entry in the
register  purporting to have been made on the basis of an instrument of transfer
or other  document so destroyed was duly and properly made and every  instrument
of transfer so destroyed was a valid and effective  instrument duly and properly

                                       45
<PAGE>
      (i) the  provisions  aforesaid  shall apply only to the  destruction  of a
document  in good  faith and  without  notice of any  claim  (regardless  of the
parties thereto) to which the document might be relevant;

      (ii) nothing  herein  contained  shall be  construed as imposing  upon the

than as  aforesaid or in any other  circumstances  which would not attach to the

      (iii)  references  herein  to  the  destruction  of any  document  include

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

42 In the case of the death of a  shareholder,  the survivors or survivor  where
the deceased was a joint  holder,  and the  executors or  administrators  of the
deceased where he was a sole or only surviving holder, shall be the only persons
recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest in the shares, but
nothing in this Article shall release the estate of a deceased  holder  (whether
sole or joint) from any liability in respect of any share held by him.

43 Any  person  becoming  entitled  to a share in  consequence  of the  death or
bankruptcy of a member may (subject as  hereinafter  provided) upon supplying to
the Company such evidence as the Directors  may  reasonably  require to show his
title to the share  either be  registered  himself  as holder of the share  upon
giving to the Company notice in writing of his desire to be registered as holder
or transfer such share to some other person.  All the limitations,  restrictions
and  provisions  of these  presents  relating to the right to  transfer  and the
registration  of transfers of shares shall be  applicable  to any such notice or
transfer  as  aforesaid  as if the death or  bankruptcy  of the  member  had not
occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer executed by such member.

44 Save as otherwise provided by or in accordance with these presents,  a person
becoming  entitled to a share in  consequence  of the death or  bankruptcy  of a
member  (upon  supplying  to the  Company  such  evidence as the  Directors  may
reasonably require to show his title to the share) shall be entitled to the same
dividends and other advantages as those to which he would be entitled if he were
the  registered  holder of the share  except  that he shall not be  entitled  in
respect  thereof  (except with the  authority of the  Directors) to exercise any
right  conferred by  membership  in relation to meetings of the Company until he
shall have been registered as a member in respect of the share.

UNTRACED SHAREHOLDERS

45 (A) The  Company  shall be  entitled  to sell the  shares  of a member or the
shares to which a person is  entitled  by  virtue  of  transmission  on death or
bankruptcy if and provided that:-

      (i) during the period of 12 years prior to the date of the  publication of
the  advertisements  referred to in  paragraph  (ii) below (or, if  published on
different dates, the later thereof) at least three dividends have become payable
on or in respect of the shares in question  but all  dividends  or other  moneys
payable on or in respect of such shares during such period remain unclaimed; and

      (ii) the Company  shall have  inserted  advertisements,  both in a leading
London  newspaper and in a newspaper  circulating  in the area of the address at
which  service of notices  upon such  member or other  person may be effected in
accordance  with these  presents  (or, if there be no such  address the Office),
giving notice of its intention to sell the said shares; and

      (iii)  during the said  period of 12 years and the period of three  months
following  the  publication  of the said  advertisements  the Company shall have
received  indication  neither of the  whereabouts  nor of the  existence of such
member or person; and

      (iv)  notice  shall have been given to the London  Stock  Exchange  of its
intention to make such sale.

      (B) To give effect to any such sale the Company may appoint some person to
execute as  transferor  an  instrument  of  transfer of the said shares and such
instrument  of transfer  shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the
registered  holder of or person  entitled by transmission to such shares and the
title of the transferee  shall not be affected by any irregularity or invalidity
in the proceedings  relating  thereto.  The net proceeds of sale shall belong to
the  Company  which  shall be obliged  to account to the former  member or other
person previously entitled as aforesaid for an amount equal to such proceeds and
shall enter the name of such former  member or other  person in the books of the
Company as a creditor for such  amount.  No trust shall be created in respect of
the debt,  no  interest  shall be payable in respect of the same and the Company
shall not be required to account for any money earned on the net proceeds, which
may be employed in the  business of the Company or invested in such  investments
(other  than  shares  of the  Company  or its  holding  company  if  any) as the
Directors may from time to time think fit.

GENERAL MEETINGS

46 An Annual  General  Meeting  shall be held once in every  year,  at such time
(within a period of not more than  fifteen  months after the holding of the last
preceding  Annual  General  Meeting)  and  place  as  may be  determined  by the
Directors.  All other General  Meetings  shall be called  Extraordinary  General
Meetings. All General Meetings shall be held in England.

47 (A) The Directors may whenever  they think fit, and shall on  requisition  in
accordance  with the  Statutes  proceed  with  proper  expedition  to convene an
Extraordinary General Meeting.

      (B) The  provisions of these presents  relating to General  Meetings shall
apply, with necessary  modifications,  to any separate meeting of the holders of
shares of a particular class which is convened otherwise than in connection with
the variation or abrogation of the rights attached to shares of that class.

NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS

48 (A) An Annual General Meeting and any Extraordinary  General Meeting at which
it is  proposed  to pass a  Special  Resolution  or  (save  as  provided  by the
Statutes) a Resolution  of which  special  notice has been given to the Company,
shall be called by twenty-one days' notice in writing (including, subject to the
provisions  of the  Statutes,  electronic  mail)  at the  least  and  any  other
Extraordinary  General  Meeting by fourteen days' notice in writing  (including,
subject to the provisions of the Statutes,  electronic  mail) at the least.  The
period of notice  shall in each case be exclusive of the day on which the notice
is served or deemed to be served  and of the day on which the  meeting  is to be
held and shall be given in manner  hereinafter  mentioned  to all members  other
than such as are not under the provisions of these presents  entitled to receive
such notices from the Company,  provided that a General Meeting  notwithstanding
that it has been called by a shorter notice than that  specified  above shall be
deemed to have been duly called if it is so agreed:-

      (i)  in the case of an Annual General Meeting by all the members entitled
to attend and vote thereat; and

      (ii) in the case of an  Extraordinary  General  Meeting by a  majority  in
number  of the  members  having a right to  attend  and  vote  thereat,  being a
majority  together  holding not less than 95 per cent.  in nominal  value of the
shares  giving  that  right.  The  accidental  omission to give notice to or the
non-receipt  of notice by any person  entitled  thereto shall not invalidate the
proceedings at any General Meeting.

      (B) The Directors may, for the purpose of  facilitating  the  organisation
and  administration  of any  General  Meeting,  from  time  to  time  make  such
arrangements  whether  involving  the issue of tickets  (on a basis  intended to
afford to all members and proxies  otherwise  entitled to attend such meeting an
equal  opportunity  of being  admitted to the meeting) or the imposition of some
random  means  of  selection  or  otherwise  as they  shall  in  their  absolute
discretion  consider to be appropriate,  and may from time to time vary any such
arrangements  or make new  arrangements  in place thereof and the entitlement of
any member or proxy to attend a General  Meeting at such place  shall be subject
to such  arrangements as may be for the time being in force and by the notice of
meeting stated to apply to that meeting.  In the case of any General  Meeting to
which such arrangements  apply the Directors shall, and in the case of any other
General  Meeting the  Directors  may, when  specifying  the place of the General
Meeting,  direct  that the  meeting  shall be held at a place  specified  in the
notice at which the  chairman  of the  meeting  shall  preside  ("the  Principal
Place") and make arrangements for simultaneous  participation at other places by
members  and  proxies  otherwise  entitled  to attend the  General  Meeting  but
excluded therefrom under the provisions of this Article or who wish to attend at
any of such other places provided that persons  attending at the Principal Place
and at any of such  other  places  shall be able to see and hear and be seen and
heard by persons attending at the Principal Place and at such other places. Such
arrangements for simultaneous  attendance may include arrangements regarding the
level of attendance  as aforesaid at such other places  provided that they shall
operate so that any such  excluded  members and proxies as aforesaid are able to
attend at one of such other places.  For the purposes of all other provisions of
these  presents any such meeting shall be treated as being held and taking place
at the Principal Place and under no  circumstance  will a failure for any reason
of  communication  equipment  or otherwise  in respect of the  arrangements  for
simultaneous attendance and participation at any other place affect the validity
of such meeting at the Principal  Place, any business  conducted  thereat or any
action taken pursuant thereto.

49 (A) Every notice  calling a General  Meeting  shall specify the place and the
day and hour of the meeting,  and there shall appear with reasonable  prominence
in every such  notice a statement  that a member  entitled to attend and vote is
entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend,  speak and vote instead of him
and that a proxy need not be a member of the Company.

      (B) In the case of an  Annual  General  Meeting,  the  notice  shall  also
specify the meeting as such.

                                       47
<PAGE>
      (C) In the case of any  General  Meeting  at  which  business  other  than
routine  business  is to be  transacted,  the notice  shall  specify the general
nature  of  such  business;  and  if  any  Resolution  is to be  proposed  as an
Extraordinary Resolution or as a Special Resolution,  the notice shall contain a
statement to that effect.

      (D) For the purposes of  determining  which persons are entitled to attend
or vote at a meeting and how many votes such  persons may cast,  the Company may
specify in the notice of the meeting a time,  not more than 48 hours  before the
time fixed for the  meeting,  by which a person who holds  shares in  registered
form must be  entered  on the  Register  in order to have the right to attend or
vote at the meeting or to appoint a proxy to do so.

50 Routine business shall mean and include only business transacted at an Annual
General Meeting of the following classes, that is to say:-

     (i)  declaring dividends;

     (ii) receiving  and/or adopting the accounts,  the reports of the Directors
          and Auditors and other documents required to be attached or annexed to
          the accounts;

     (iii)appointing or  re-appointing  Directors to fill  vacancies  arising at
          the meeting on retirement whether by rotation or otherwise;

     (iv) re-appointing  the retiring  Auditors (unless they were last appointed
          otherwise than by the Company in General Meeting);

     (v)  fixing the  remuneration  of the Auditors or determining the manner in
          which such remuneration is to be fixed.

PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS

51 Subject to Article  138,  the  Chairman of the  Directors,  failing  whom the
Deputy Chairman,  shall preside as chairman at a General Meeting. If there be no
such Chairman or Deputy Chairman, or if at any meeting neither be present within
five  minutes  after the time  appointed  for holding the meeting and willing to
act, the Directors  present shall choose one of their number (or, if no Director
be  present  or if all the  Directors  present  decline  to take the  chair) the
members present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

52 No business  other than the  appointment of a chairman shall be transacted at
any  General  Meeting  unless a quorum is present  at the time when the  meeting
proceeds to business. Five members present in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote shall be a quorum for all purposes.

53 If within five minutes from the time appointed for a General Meeting (or such
longer  interval as the chairman of the meeting may think fit to allow) a quorum
is not present, the meeting, if convened on the requisition of members, shall be
dissolved. In any other case it shall stand adjourned to such other day and such
time  and  place  as may have  been  specified  for the  purpose  in the  notice
convening  the meeting or (if not so  specified)  as the chairman of the meeting
may  determine  and in the latter case not less than seven  days'  notice of the
adjourned  meeting  shall be given in like manner as in the case of the original
meeting.  At the adjourned meeting any two members present in person or by proxy
shall be a quorum.

54 The chairman of any General  Meeting at which a quorum is present may with or
without  the consent of the  meeting  (and shall if so directed by the  meeting)
adjourn the meeting from time to time (or sine die) and from place to place, and
if it appears to the chairman that it is likely to be  impracticable  to hold or
continue  the meeting  because of the numbers of members and proxies  wishing to
attend the  meeting  who are not  present he may  adjourn the meeting to another
time and place  (or sine  die)  without  the need for any such  consent,  but no
business  shall be transacted at any adjourned  meeting  except  business  which
might  lawfully have been  transacted at the meeting from which the  adjournment
took place.  Where a meeting is  adjourned  sine die, the time and place for the
adjourned  meeting shall be fixed by the Directors.  When a meeting is adjourned
for thirty  days or more or sine die,  not less than seven  days'  notice of the
adjourned  meeting  shall be given in like manner as in the case of the original
meeting.

55 Save as hereinbefore  expressly  provided,  it shall not be necessary to give
any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned
meeting.

56 If an amendment shall be proposed to any Resolution under  consideration  but
shall in good faith be ruled out of order by the  chairman  of the  meeting  the
proceedings on the substantive  Resolution shall not be invalidated by any error
in such  ruling.  In the case of a  Resolution  duly  proposed  as a Special  or
Extraordinary  Resolution  no  amendment  thereto  (other  than a mere  clerical
amendment  to correct a patent  error) may in any event be  considered  or voted
upon.

                                       48
<PAGE>
57 At any General  Meeting all  Substantive  Resolutions  put to the vote of the
meeting shall be decided on a poll and all Other  Resolutions put to the vote of
the meeting  shall be decided on a show of hands  unless a poll is (before or on
the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded by:-

     (i)  the chairman of the meeting, or

     (ii) not less than five members  present in person or by proxy and entitled
          to vote; or

     (iii)a member or  members  present  in person or by proxy and  representing
          not less than  one-tenth of the total voting rights of all the members
          having the right to vote at the meeting; or

     (iv) a member or members  present in person or by proxy and holding  shares
          in the Company  conferring a right to vote at the meeting being shares
          on which an  aggregate  sum has  been  paid up equal to not less  than
          one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares  conferring  that
          right.  The chairman of the meeting shall use his absolute  discretion
          to  determine  whether  a  resolution  is  an  Other  Resolution  or a
          Substantive Resolution and his decision shall be final.

58 A demand for a poll may be withdrawn only with the approval of the meeting. A
demand so withdrawn shall not be taken to have  invalidated the result of a show
of hands on an Other  Resolution  declared before the demand was made.  Unless a
poll is required or demanded a  declaration  by the chairman of the meeting that
an Other Resolution has been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular
majority,  or lost,  and an entry to that  effect in the minute  book,  shall be
conclusive  evidence of that fact without  proof of the number or  proportion of
the votes  recorded  for or against  such  Resolution.  If a poll is required or
demanded,  it shall be taken in such  manner  (including  the use of  ballot  or
voting  papers or  tickets) as the  chairman of the meeting may direct,  and the
result of the poll shall be deemed to be the  Resolution of the meeting at which
the poll was  demanded.  The  chairman of the meeting may (and if so directed by
the meeting shall) appoint  scrutineers and may adjourn the meeting to someplace
and time fixed by him for the purpose of declaring the result of the poll.

59 In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll,
the  chairman  of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which
the poll is demanded shall be entitled to a casting vote.

60 A poll  demanded on the choice of a chairman or on a question of  adjournment
shall be taken  forthwith.  A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken
either  immediately or at such  subsequent time (not being more than thirty days
from the date of the meeting)  and place as the  chairman may direct.  No notice
need be given of a poll not taken  immediately.  The demand for a poll shall not
prevent the continuance of the meeting for the transaction of any business other
than the question on which the poll has been demanded.

VOTES OF MEMBERS

61  (A)  Subject  to  Articles  49(D)  and  63 and  to  any  special  rights  or
restrictions  as to voting  attached to any class of shares,  on a show of hands
every member who is present in person and every person present who has been duly
appointed  as a proxy  shall  have one vote and on a poll  every  member  who is
present  in person or by proxy  shall have two votes for every  [sterling]  5 in
nominal amount of the First Preference  Shares and Second  Preference Shares and
one vote for every US$0.25 in nominal  amount of all other shares of which he is
the holder or in respect of which his appointment as proxy has been made.

      (B) In the case of joint  holders  of a share the vote of the  senior  who
tenders  a vote,  whether  in  person  or by  proxy,  shall be  accepted  to the
exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and for this purpose seniority
shall be  determined  by the order in which the names  stand in the  Register of
Members in respect of the share.

62 Where in England or elsewhere a receiver or other  person (by  whatever  name
called) has been appointed by any court claiming  jurisdiction in that behalf to
exercise  powers  with  respect to the  property or affairs of any member on the
ground  (however  formulated)  of mental  disorder,  the  Directors may in their
absolute  discretion,  upon or subject to  production  of such  evidence  of the
appointment  as the Directors may require,  permit such receiver or other person
on behalf of such member to vote in person or by proxy at any General Meeting or
to exercise any other right  conferred by  membership in relation to meetings of
the Company.

63 No member shall,  unless the Directors  otherwise  determine,  be entitled in
respect of shares held by him to vote at a General Meeting either  personally or
by proxy or to exercise any other right  conferred by  membership in relation to
meetings of the Company if any call or other sum presently payable by him to the
Company in respect of such shares remains unpaid.

64 No objection  shall be raised as to the  admissibility  of any vote except at
the  meeting or  adjourned  meeting at which the vote  objected  to is or may be
given or tendered and every vote not  disallowed  at such meeting shall be valid
for all purposes.  Any such  objection  shall be referred to the chairman of the
meeting whose decision shall be final and conclusive.

65 On a poll  votes  may be given  either  personally  or by proxy  and a person
entitled  to more than one vote need not use all his votes or cast all the votes
he uses in the same way.

66 A proxy need not be a member of the Company.

                                       49
<PAGE>
67 (A) Subject to Article  68(B),  an instrument  appointing a proxy shall be in
writing in any usual or common form or in any other form which the Directors may
approve and:-

     (i)  in the case of an  individual  shall be signed by the appointor or his
          attorney; and

     (ii) in the case of a  corporation  shall be either  given under its common
          seal or  signed  on its  behalf by an  attorney  or a duly  authorised
          officer of the corporation.  The signature on such instrument need not
          be  witnessed.  Where an  instrument  appointing  a proxy is signed on
          behalf  of the  appointor  by an  attorney,  the  letter  or  power of
          attorney or a duly  certified  copy  thereof  must  (failing  previous
          registration  with the Company) be lodged with the instrument of proxy
          pursuant to the next following  Article,  failing which the instrument
          may be treated as invalid.

      (B) A proxy may also be appointed in accordance with Articles 145, 147 and
150.

68 (A) An  instrument  appointing  a proxy  must be left at such place or one of
such places (if any) as may be specified for the purpose in or by way of note to
or in any  document  accompanying  the notice  convening  the meeting (or, if no
place is so specified,  at the Transfer Office) not less than forty-eight  hours
(or such shorter time as the Directors may determine)  before the time appointed
for the  holding of the meeting or  adjourned  meeting or (in the case of a poll
taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting or adjourned  meeting)
for the taking of the poll at which it is to be used,  and in default  shall not
be  treated as valid.  The  instrument  shall,  unless  the  contrary  is stated
thereon,  be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting
to which it relates,  provided that an instrument of proxy relating to more than
one meeting  (including any  adjournment  thereof) having once been so delivered
for the purposes of any meeting  shall not require again to be delivered for the
purposes of any subsequent meeting to which it relates.

      (B) Subject to the  provisions of the Statutes,  the Directors may allow a
proxy to be appointed in electronic form, by telephone or by facsimile,  subject
to any  limitations,  conditions  or  restrictions  that they decide and Article
67(A) shall not apply in relation to an instrument  appointing a proxy delivered
in  this  way.  The  Directors  may  establish  such  procedures  as  they  deem
appropriate  to  receive  and  verify  the  validity  and  acceptance  of  proxy
appointments delivered in such manner.

69 (A) An instrument  appointing a proxy shall be deemed to include the right to
demand  or join in  demanding  a poll and shall  confer  the right to speak at a
meeting.

      (B) A vote cast by proxy shall not be invalidated by the previous death or
insanity of the principal or by the  revocation of the  appointment of the proxy
or of the  authority  under which the  appointment  was made,  provided  that no
intimation in writing of such death,  insanity or revocation  (which  revocation
may also be effected electronically or by telephone) shall have been received by
the Company at the Transfer Office 48 hours or such lesser time as the Directors
may determine before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting or (in
the case of a poll taken  otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting or
adjourned  meeting) the time  appointed  for the taking of the poll at which the
vote is  cast.  The  Directors  may  establish  such  procedures  as  they  deem
appropriate  to receive and verify the validity and acceptance of the revocation
of proxy.

DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS

70 (A) If any member,  or any other person  appearing to be interested in shares
held by such member, has been duly served with a notice under Section 212 of the
Act and is in default for the Prescribed  Period in supplying to the Company the
information  thereby  required,   then  the  Directors  may  in  their  absolute
discretion  at any time  thereafter  by notice (a  "Direction  Notice")  to such
member  direct  that in respect of the shares in  relation  to which the default
occurred  (the "Default  Shares")  (which  expression  shall include any further
shares  which are issued in respect of such shares) the member shall not (for so
long as the  default  continues)  nor shall any  transferee  to whom any of such
shares are transferred  (other than pursuant to an approved transfer or pursuant
to Article  70(C) below) be entitled to vote either  personally or by proxy at a
General  Meeting  of the  Company  or a meeting  of the  holders of any class of
shares of the Company or to exercise any other right  conferred by membership in
relation  to General  Meetings  of the Company or meetings of the holders of any
class of shares of the Company.

      (B) The Company shall send to each other person appearing to be interested
in the shares the subject of any Direction Notice a copy of the said Notice, but
the  failure  or  omission  by the  Company to do so shall not  invalidate  such
Direction Notice.

                                       50
<PAGE>
      (C) Where the Default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. of the
issued shares of that class then the Direction Notice may additionally direct:-

      (i) that any cash dividend or other money which would otherwise be payable
in respect of each of the Default Shares shall (in whole or any part thereof) be
retained by the Company without any liability to pay interest  thereon when such
dividend or other money is finally paid to the member; and/or

      (ii) that no transfer of any of the shares held by such member shall be
registered unless:-

      (a) the  member  is not  himself  in  default  as  regards  supplying  the
information  required and the  transfer is of part only of the member's  holding
and when  presented for  registration  is  accompanied  by a certificate  by the
member in a form  satisfactory to the Directors to the effect that after due and
careful  enquiry  the member is  satisfied  that no person in default as regards
supplying such information is interested in any of the shares the subject of the
transfer; or

      (b)   the transfer is an approved transfer.

      (D) Where any person  appearing to be interested in the Default Shares has
been duly served with a Direction  Notice and the Default  Shares  which are the
subject  of such  Direction  Notice  are  held by an  Approved  Depositary,  the
provisions  of this  Article  shall be treated as applying  only to such Default
Shares  held by the  Approved  Depositary  and  not  (insofar  as such  person's
apparent  interest  is  concerned)  to any  other  shares  held by the  Approved
Depositary.

      (E) Where the  member on which a notice  under  Section  212 of the Act is
served is an Approved Depositary acting in its capacity as such, the obligations
of the  Approved  Depositary  as a member of the  Company  shall be  limited  to
disclosing to the Company such  information  relating to any person appearing to
be  interested  in the shares held by it as has been  recorded by it pursuant to
the  arrangements  entered  into by the  Company or  approved  by the  Directors
pursuant to which it was appointed as an Approved Depositary.

      (F) Any Direction  Notice shall have effect in  accordance  with its terms
for so long as the default in respect of which the  Direction  Notice was issued
continues and (unless the  Directors  otherwise  determine)  for a period of one
week thereafter but shall cease to have effect in relation to any Default Shares
which are  transferred  by such  member by means of an  approved  transfer.  The
Directors may at any time give notice cancelling a Direction Notice.

      (G)   For the purpose of this Article:-

      (i) a person shall be treated as appearing to be  interested in any shares
if the member holding such shares has given to the Company a notification  under
the said  Section 212 of the Act which  either (a) names such person as being so
interested or (b) fails to establish the  identities of those  interested in the
shares  and (after  taking  into  account  the said  notification  and any other
relevant Section 212  notification) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to
believe or suspects on reasonable  grounds that the person in question is or may
be interested in the shares;

      (ii) the  Prescribed  Period  is 28 days from the date of  service  of the
notice under the said Section 212 except that if the Default Shares represent at
least 0.25 per cent. of the issued shares of that class,  the Prescribed  Period
is 14 days from such date; and

      (iii) a transfer of shares is an approved transfer if but only if:-

      (a) it is a transfer of shares to an offeror by way or in pursuance of
acceptance of a take-over offer for a company (as defined in Section 428 of the
Act); or

      (b) the Directors  are  satisfied  that the transfer is made pursuant to a
sale  of the  whole  of  the  beneficial  ownership  of the  shares  to a  party
unconnected with the member and with other persons appearing to be interested in
such shares; or

      (c) the transfer results from a sale made through a recognised  investment
exchange  as  defined  in the  Financial  Services  Act 1986 or any other  stock
exchange  outside the United Kingdom on which the Company's  shares are normally
traded.

      (H)  Nothing  contained  in this  Article  shall  limit  the  power of the
Directors under Section 216 of the Act.

CORPORATIONS ACTING BY REPRESENTATIVES

71 Any corporation which is a member of the Company may authorise such person as
it thinks fit to act as its  representative  at any meeting of the Company or of
any class of members of the Company. A person so authorised shall be entitled to
exercise  the same  powers on  behalf of the  grantor  of the  authority  as the
grantor  could  exercise if it were an individual  member of the Company,  and a
person so authorised shall, if present at any such meeting,  for the purposes of
these presents be deemed to be a member present in person at such meeting.

                                       51

DIRECTORS

72 (A) Subject as  hereinafter  provided,  the number of Directors  shall not be
less  than  three  nor more  than  twenty  two (or such  lesser  maximum  as the
Directors may from time to time resolve).

      (B) The  Company  may by  Ordinary  Resolution  from time to time vary the
minimum number and/or maximum number of Directors.

73 A Director  shall not be required to hold any shares of the Company by way of
qualification.  A Director who is not a member of the Company shall nevertheless
be entitled to attend and speak at General Meetings.

74 The remuneration payable to the Directors for their services in such capacity
shall be  determined  from time to time by Ordinary  Resolution  of the Company.
Such amount  shall be divided  among the  Directors as they may agree unless the
resolution  provides  otherwise.  The amount of  remuneration so determined will
include  remuneration  for serving as Chairman or Deputy Chairman and serving on
committees  of Directors  but will not include  remuneration  of  Directors  for
performing an executive office of the Company.

75 The  Directors may repay to any Director all such  reasonable  expenses as he
may incur in attending  and  returning  from meetings of the Directors or of any
committee  of the  Directors  or General  Meetings or  otherwise in or about the
business of the Company.

76 The  Directors  shall  have power to pay and agree to pay  pensions  or other
retirement, superannuation, death or disability benefits to (or to any person in
respect of) any Director or  ex-Director  and for the purpose of  providing  any
such  pensions or other  benefits to  contribute to any scheme or fund or to pay
premiums.

77 A  Director  may be  party to or in any way  interested  in any  contract  or
arrangement  or  transaction  to which  the  Company  is a party or in which the
Company is in any way  interested  and he may hold and be remunerated in respect
of any  office or place of profit  (other  than the  office  of  Auditor  of the
Company or any  subsidiary  thereof)  under the Company or any other  company in
which the Company is in any way  interested and he (or any firm of which he is a
member)  may act in a  professional  capacity  for the Company or any such other
company and be remunerated  therefor and in any such case as aforesaid  (save as
otherwise agreed) he may retain for his own absolute use and benefit all profits
and advantages accruing to him thereunder or in consequence thereof.

78 (A) The  Directors may from time to time appoint one or more of their body to
be the holder of any executive  office on such terms (including such terms as to
remuneration  by way of salary,  commission or otherwise) and for such period as
they may (subject to the  provisions of the  Statutes)  determine  and,  without
prejudice to the terms of any contract  entered into in any particular case, may
at any time revoke any such appointment.

      (B) The  appointment  of any  Director to the office of Chairman or Deputy
Chairman shall automatically determine if he ceases to be a Director but without
prejudice to any claim for damages for breach of any contract of service between
him and the Company.

      (C) The  appointment  of any  Director to an  executive  office  shall not
automatically determine if he ceases from any cause to be a Director, unless the
contract  or  resolution  under  which he holds  office  shall  expressly  state
otherwise,  in which event such determination  shall be without prejudice to any
claim for  damages  for breach of any  contract  of service  between him and the
Company.

79 The  Directors  may  entrust  to and confer  upon any  Director  holding  any
executive  office any of the powers  exercisable  by them as Directors upon such
terms and  conditions and with such  restrictions  as they think fit, and either
collaterally with or to the exclusion of their own powers,  and may from time to
time revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any of such powers.

APPOINTMENT AND RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS

80 Any  provision  of the Statutes  which,  subject to the  provisions  of these
presents,  would  have  the  effect  of  rendering  any  person  ineligible  for
appointment as a Director or liable to vacate office as a Director on account of
his having reached any specified age or of requiring special notice or any other
special  formality in  connection  with the  appointment  of any Director over a
specified age, shall apply to the Company.

81 The office of a Director shall be vacated in any of the following events,
namely:-

      (i)   if he shall become prohibited by law from acting as a Director;

      (ii) if he shall  resign in  writing  left at the Office or if he shall in
writing offer to resign and the Directors shall resolve to accept such offer;

      (iii) if he shall have a receiving order made against him or shall
compound with his creditors generally;

      (iv) if in  England  or  elsewhere  an order  shall  be made by any  court
claiming  jurisdiction  in that  behalf on the ground  (however  formulated)  of
mental  disorder for his detention or for the  appointment  of a guardian or for
the  appointment  of a receiver or other  person (by  whatever  name  called) to
exercise powers with respect to his property or affairs.

                                       52
<PAGE>
82 At each Annual General  Meeting all those  Directors who have held office for
three  years or more since they were  elected or  re-elected  shall  retire from
office by rotation.

83    A retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election.

84 The Company at the meeting at which a Director retires under any provision of
these  presents  may by Ordinary  Resolution  fill the office  being  vacated by
electing  thereto  the  retiring  Director  or some other  person  eligible  for
appointment.  In  default  the  retiring  Director  shall be deemed to have been
re-elected except in any of the following cases:-

      (i) where at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such office
or a Resolution  for the  re-election of such Director is put to the meeting and
lost;

      (ii)  where such Director has given notice in writing to the Company that
he is unwilling to be re-elected;

      (iii) where the default is due to the moving of a Resolution in
contravention of the next following Article;

      (iv)  where such Director has attained any retiring age applicable to him
as Director.

The retirement  shall not have effect until the conclusion of the meeting except
where a  Resolution  is passed to elect  some  other  person in the place of the
retiring  Director or a Resolution for his re-election is put to the meeting and
lost and  accordingly  a retiring  Director who is  re-elected or deemed to have
been re-elected will continue in office without a break.

85 A  Resolution  for the  appointment  of two or more persons as Directors by a
single  Resolution shall not be moved at any General Meeting unless a Resolution
that it shall be so moved has first been  agreed to by the  meeting  without any
vote being given against it; and any Resolution  moved in  contravention of this
provision shall be void.

86 No person  other  than a  Director  retiring  at the  meeting  shall,  unless
recommended  by the  Directors for election,  be eligible for  appointment  as a
Director  at any  General  Meeting  unless  not less  than  seven  nor more than
forty-two  days  (inclusive of the date on which the notice is given) before the
date appointed for the meeting there shall have been lodged at the Office notice
in writing  signed by some member  (other than the person to be  proposed)  duly
qualified  to attend and vote at the  meeting  for which such notice is given of
his  intention  to propose  such person for  election and also notice in writing
signed by the person to be proposed of his willingness to be elected.

87 The  Company may in  accordance  with and  subject to the  provisions  of the
Statutes by Ordinary  Resolution of which  special  notice has been given remove
any Director from office  (notwithstanding any provision of these presents or of
any agreement  between the Company and such Director,  but without  prejudice to
any claim he may have for damages for breach of any such  agreement) and appoint
another person in place of a Director so removed from office. In default of such
appointment  the vacancy  arising upon the removal of a Director from office may
be filled as a casual vacancy.

88 The Company may by  Ordinary  Resolution  appoint any person to be a Director
either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director.  Without prejudice
thereto  the  Directors  shall  have power at any time so to do, but so that the
total number of Directors  shall not thereby  exceed the maximum number (if any)
fixed by or in accordance  with these  presents.  Any person so appointed by the
Directors  shall hold office only until the next General  Meeting and shall then
be eligible for re-election.

MEETINGS AND PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

89 (A)  Subject to the  provisions  of these  presents  the  Directors  may meet
together for the  despatch of business,  adjourn and  otherwise  regulate  their
meetings as they think fit.

      (B) Subject  always to Article  89(A),  all or any of the Directors or any
committee  thereof  may  participate  in a  meeting  of the  Directors  or  that
committee by means of a  conference  telephone  or any  communication  equipment
which allows all persons  participating  in the meeting to hear each other.  Any
person so  participating  shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting
and shall be  entitled  to vote or be  counted in a quorum  accordingly.  Such a
meeting  shall  be  deemed  to take  place  where  the  largest  group  of those
participating is assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the chairman of
the meeting is then present.

90 At any time any Director  may,  and the  Secretary  on the  requisition  of a
Director shall, summon a meeting of the Directors. Any Director may waive notice
of any meeting and any such waiver may be retroactive.

91 The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the Directors may
be fixed  from time to time by the  Directors  and  unless so fixed at any other
number  shall be two.  A meeting of the  Directors  at which a quorum is present
shall be  competent to exercise  all powers and  discretions  for the time being
exercisable by the Directors.

92 Questions  arising at any meeting of the  Directors  shall be determined by a
majority of votes.  In case of an equality of votes the  chairman of the meeting
shall have a second or casting vote.

                                       53
<PAGE>
93 (A) Save as herein  provided,  a  Director  shall not vote in  respect of any
contract or  arrangement  or any other  proposal  whatsoever in which he has any
material  interest  otherwise  than by  virtue  of his  interests  in  shares or
debentures  or other  securities  of or otherwise  in or through the Company.  A
Director  shall not be counted in the  quorum at a meeting  in  relation  to any
resolution on which he is debarred from voting.

      (B) Subject to the  provisions  of the  Statutes a Director  shall (in the
absence of some other material  interest than is indicated below) be entitled to
vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of any resolution  concerning any
of the following matters, namely:-

      (i)   the giving of any security or indemnity to him in respect of money
lent or obligations incurred by him at the request of or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries;

      (ii) the giving of any  security or  indemnity to a third party in respect
of a debt or obligation of the Company or any of its  subsidiaries  for which he
himself has  assumed  responsibility  in whole or in part under a  guarantee  or
indemnity or by the giving of security;

      (iii) any proposal  concerning  an offer of shares or  debentures or other
securities of or by the Company or any of its  subsidiaries  for subscription or
purchase in which offer he is or is to be  interested  as a  participant  in the
underwriting or sub-underwriting thereof;

      (iv) any proposal  concerning any other company in which he is interested,
directly or  indirectly  and whether as an officer or  shareholder  or otherwise
howsoever, provided that he (together with persons connected with him within the
meaning  of  Section  346 of the  Act)  is not  the  holder  of or  beneficially
interested  in one per cent.  or more of the issued  shares of any class of such
company (or of any third  company  through  which his interest is derived) or of
the  voting  rights  available  to  members of the  relevant  company  (any such
interest being deemed for the purposes of this Article to be a material interest
in all circumstances);

      (v) any proposal  concerning the adoption,  modification or operation of a
superannuation  fund or retirement  benefits  scheme or Employees'  Share Scheme
under which he may  benefit and which has been  approved by or is subject to and
conditional  upon approval by the Board of Inland Revenue for taxation  purposes
or by the Company in General Meeting;

      (vi) any  proposal  concerning  the  purchase  and/or  maintenance  of any
insurance policy under which he may benefit.

      (C) Where  proposals are under  consideration  concerning the  appointment
(including  fixing or varying the terms of appointment) of two or more Directors
to offices or  employments  with the Company or any company in which the Company
is interested,  such proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each
Director  separately  and in such case each of the  Directors  concerned (if not
debarred from voting under paragraph (B) (iv) of this Article) shall be entitled
to vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution except that
concerning his own appointment.

      (D) If any  question  shall arise at any time as to the  materiality  of a
Director's  interest or as to the  entitlement  of any Director to vote and such
question is not  resolved by his  voluntarily  agreeing to abstain  from voting,
such question shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and his ruling in
relation to any other Director  shall be final and  conclusive  except in a case
where the nature or extent of the interests of such Director has not been fairly
disclosed.

      (E) The Company may by Ordinary Resolution suspend or relax the provisions
of this Article to any extent or ratify any  transaction  not duly authorised by
reason of a contravention of this Article.

94 The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancies, but if and so
long as the number of Directors is reduced below the minimum  number fixed by or
in accordance  with these presents the continuing  Directors or Director may act
for the purpose of filling such vacancies or of summoning General Meetings,  but
not for any other purpose.  If there be no Directors or Director able or willing
to act,  then any two  members  may summon a General  Meeting for the purpose of
appointing Directors.

95 (A) The  Directors  may  elect  from  their  number a  Chairman  and a Deputy
Chairman (or two or more Deputy  Chairmen)  and  determine  the period for which
each is to hold  office.  If no  Chairman  or Deputy  Chairman  shall  have been
appointed or if at any meeting of the  Directors no Chairman or Deputy  Chairman
shall be present  within five minutes  after the time  appointed for holding the
meeting,  the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of
the meeting.

      (B) If at any time there is more than one Deputy Chairman the right in the
absence of the  Chairman  to preside  at a meeting  of the  Directors  or of the
Company shall be determined as between the Deputy Chairmen present (if more than
one) by seniority in length of  appointment  as Deputy  Chairman or otherwise as
resolved by the Directors.

96 A resolution in writing  signed by all the Directors  shall be effective as a
resolution  duly passed at a meeting of the Directors held in the United Kingdom
and may  consist of several  documents  in the like form,  each signed by one or
more  Directors.  The  documents  may be facsimile or  electronic  copies of the
resolution,  in which case the resolution shall be effective upon receipt by the
Secretary of the final document.

                                       54
<PAGE>
97 The Directors may delegate any of their powers or  discretions  to committees
consisting of one or more members of their body and (if thought fit) one or more
other persons co-opted as hereinafter provided. Any committee so formed shall in
the exercise of the powers so  delegated  conform to any  regulations  which may
from time to time be imposed by the Directors.  Any such regulations may provide
for or authorise the co-option to the committee of persons other than  Directors
and for such co-opted  members to have voting rights as members of the committee
but so that (a) the number of co-opted  members  shall be less than  one-half of
the total  number of  members  of the  committee  and (b) no  resolution  of the
committee  shall be effective  unless a majority of the members of the committee
present at the meeting are Directors.

98 The meetings and proceedings of any such committee  consisting of two or more
members shall be governed  mutatis  mutandis by the provisions of these presents
regulating the meetings and proceedings of the Directors, so far as the same are
not superseded by any regulations made by the Directors under the last preceding
Article.

99 All acts done by any meeting of Directors,  or of any such  committee,  or by
any person acting as a Director or as a member of any such  committee,  shall as
regards all persons dealing in good faith with the Company, notwithstanding that
there  was some  defect  in the  appointment  of any of the  persons  acting  as
aforesaid,  or that any such persons were disqualified or had vacated office, or
were not  entitled  to vote,  be as valid as if every such  person had been duly
appointed  and was qualified and had continued to be a Director or member of the
committee and had been entitled to vote.

BORROWING POWERS

100 (A) Subject as  hereinafter  provided and to the  provisions of the Statutes
the Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, and to
mortgage or charge its undertaking,  property and uncalled capital, and to issue
debentures and other securities,  whether outright or as collateral security for
any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.

      (B) The  Directors  shall  restrict  the  borrowings  of the  Company  and
exercise  all voting and other  rights or powers of control  exercisable  by the
Company in relation to its subsidiaries incorporated in the United Kingdom so as
to secure that the aggregate amount for the time being remaining undischarged of
all moneys borrowed by the Company and/or any of its  subsidiaries  incorporated
in the United Kingdom  (exclusive of moneys borrowed by the Company from and for
the time being owing to any such  subsidiary or by any such  subsidiary from and
for the time being owing to the Company or another such  subsidiary)  shall not,
except  with the  consent of the  Company in  General  Meeting,  at any one time
exceed:-

      (i)  the amount paid up on the Share Capital of the Company for the time
being issued, plus

      (ii) the  aggregate of the sums for the time being  standing to the credit
of the  Capital  and  Revenue  Reserves  (including  Share  Premium  Account and
Undistributed  Profits  but  excluding  amounts set aside for  Taxation)  of the
Company and its subsidiaries  incorporated in the United Kingdom as appearing in
the latest audited accounts of those Companies.

      (C)   For the purposes of the said limits:-

      (i) the  issue of  debentures  shall be  deemed  to  constitute  borrowing
notwithstanding  that  the  same  may  be  issued  in  whole  or in  part  for a
consideration other than cash;

      (ii) moneys  borrowed  for the purpose of repaying or  redeeming  (with or
without  premium) in whole or in part any other  borrowed  moneys  falling to be
taken into account and intended to be applied for such purpose within six months
after the borrowing  thereof shall not during such period,  except to the extent
so applied, themselves be taken into account;

      (iii) any  amounts  borrowed  from  bankers or others  for the  purpose of
financing  any  contract  up to an amount not  exceeding  that part of the price
receivable  under such  contract  which is  guaranteed  or insured by the Export
Credits  Guarantee  Department or other like  institution  carrying on a similar
business shall be deemed not to be borrowed moneys;

      (iv) borrowed moneys expressed in or calculated by reference to a currency
other than sterling  shall be translated  into sterling by reference to the rate
of exchange  used for the  conversion  of such  currency  in the latest  audited
balance  sheet of the  relevant  company or, if the  relevant  currency  was not
thereby  involved,  by reference to the rate of exchange or approximate  rate of
exchange  ruling on such date and  determined  on such basis as the Auditors may
determine or approve.

                                       55
<PAGE>
      (D) No person dealing with the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be
concerned  to see or  enquire  whether  the said limit is  observed  and no debt
incurred  or  security  given  in  excess  of such  limit  shall be  invalid  or
ineffectual  unless the lender or the recipient of the security had, at the time
when the debt was incurred or security given, express notice that the said limit
had been or would thereby be exceeded.

GENERAL POWERS OF DIRECTORS

101 (A) The  business  and  affairs  of the  Company  shall  be  managed  by the
Directors,  who may  exercise  all such  powers of the Company as are not by the
Statutes or by these presents required to be exercised by the Company in General
Meeting,  subject  nevertheless  to any  regulations of these  presents,  to the
provisions of the Statutes and to such regulations,  being not inconsistent with
the  aforesaid  regulations  or  provisions,  as may be  prescribed  by  Special
Resolution  of the  Company,  but no  regulation  so made by the  Company  shall
invalidate  any prior act of the  Directors  which would have been valid if such
regulation had not been made. The general powers given by this Article shall not
be  limited  or  restricted  by any  special  authority  or  power  given to the
Directors by any other Article.

      (B) The Directors shall ensure that the head office of the Company remains
in England at all times.

102 The Directors may establish any local boards or agencies for managing any of
the affairs of the Company,  either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere,  and may
appoint  any  persons to be members of such local  boards,  or any  managers  or
agents,  and may fix their  remuneration,  and may  delegate to any local board,
manager or agent any of the powers,  authorities and  discretions  vested in the
Directors,  with power to  sub-delegate,  and may  authorise  the members of any
local  boards,  or any of  them,  to  fill  any  vacancies  therein,  and to act
notwithstanding  vacancies,  and any such  appointment or delegation may be made
upon such terms and subject to such  conditions  as the Directors may think fit,
and the directors may remove any person so appointed,  and may annul or vary any
such  delegation,  but no person dealing in good faith and without notice of any
such annulment or variation shall be affected thereby.

103 The  Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney or
otherwise  appoint  any  company,  firm or  person  or any  fluctuating  body of
persons,  whether nominated  directly or indirectly by the Directors,  to be the
attorney or  attorneys  of the Company for such  purposes  and with such powers,
authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the
Directors  under  these  presents)  and for  such  period  and  subject  to such
conditions  as they may think fit,  and any such power of  attorney  may contain
such  provisions for the protection and  convenience of persons dealing with any
such attorney as the  Directors  may think fit, and may also  authorise any such
attorney to sub-delegate  all or any of the powers,  authorities and discretions
vested in him.

104 Subject to and to the extent permitted by the Statutes,  the Company, or the
Directors  on behalf of the  Company,  may cause to be kept in any  territory  a
branch  register of members  resident in such  territory,  and the Directors may
make and vary such  regulations  as they may think fit respecting the keeping of
any such register.

105 All  cheques,  promissory  notes,  drafts,  bills  of  exchange,  and  other
negotiable or transferable instruments,  and all receipts for moneys paid to the
Company, shall be signed, drawn,  accepted,  endorsed, or otherwise executed, as
the case may be, in such  manner  as the  Directors  shall  from time to time by
Resolution determine.

SECRETARY

106 The Secretary shall be appointed by the Directors on such terms and for such
period as they may think fit.  Any  Secretary  so  appointed  may at any time be
removed  from office by the  Directors,  but without  prejudice to any claim for
damages for breach of any contract of service  between him and the  Company.  If
thought  fit two or more  persons may be  appointed  as Joint  Secretaries.  The
Directors may also appoint from time to time on such terms as they may think fit
one or more  Deputy  Secretaries,  Assistant  Secretaries  and Deputy  Assistant
Secretaries.  A signature or attestation or  certification of or on any document
by a Deputy,  Assistant or Deputy Assistant  Secretary in that capacity shall in
favour  of any  person  dealing  with the  Company  on the faith  thereof  be as
effective as if it were the signature or attestation or  certification  of or on
such document by the Secretary.

AUTHENTICATION OF DOCUMENTS

107 Any Director or the  Secretary or any person  appointed by the Directors for
the  purpose  shall have  power to  authenticate  any  documents  affecting  the
constitution  of the  Company and any  Resolutions  passed by the Company or the
Directors  or any  committee,  and any books,  records,  documents  and accounts
relating  to the  business  of the  Company,  and to certify  copies  thereof or
extracts  there from as true copies or extracts;  and where any books,  records,
documents  or accounts  are  elsewhere  than at the Office the local  manager or
other officer of the Company having the custody  thereof shall be deemed to be a
person  appointed by the Directors as aforesaid.  A document  purporting to be a
copy of a  Resolution,  or an extract  from the  minutes  of a  meeting,  of the
Company or of the  Directors  or any  committee  which is certified as aforesaid
shall be conclusive  evidence in favour of all persons  dealing with the Company
upon the faith thereof that such Resolution has been duly passed or, as the case
may  be,  that  any  minute  so  extracted  is a true  and  accurate  record  of
proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.

RESERVES

108 (A)  After  payment  of the  dividends  upon any  Preference  Shares  of the
Company,  and of a dividend of 4.2 per cent.  upon the  Ordinary  Shares,  there
shall be set aside a Special  Reserve  Fund out of the balance of the profits of
each year such sum as the Directors may determine,  and no part of the moneys so
set  aside  nor of  the  interest  thereon  shall  without  the  sanction  of an
Extraordinary  Resolution  of the  holders of the  Preference  Shares be applied
otherwise  than for the purpose of making up any deficit of cumulative  dividend
on the Preference Shares, or in the event of a reduction of capital or a winding
up, for the  purpose of repaying  to the  holders of the  Preference  Shares the
amounts  paid up on such shares  together  with the 10 per cent.  referred to in
sub-paragraphs  (i) and (ii) of  paragraph  (A) of Article 3 but the same may be
used by the Directors as part of the working capital of the Company.  All moneys
from time to time  standing  to the credit of the  Special  Reserve  Fund may be
invested in or upon such  securities or investments as the Directors shall think
fit, including the debentures of any company formed or promoted by this Company,
or in which this Company shall hold shares.

      (B) The  Directors  may from time to time set aside out of the  profits of
the  Company  and carry to a general  reserve  such  further  sums as they think
proper which,  at the discretion of the  Directors,  shall be applicable for any
purpose to which the profits of the Company may  properly be applied and pending
such  application  may either be employed  in the  business of the Company or be
invested.  The Directors may divide the general  reserve into such special funds
as they think fit and may  consolidate  into one fund any  special  funds or any
parts of any special funds into which the general reserve may have been divided.
The  Directors  may also without  placing the same to reserve  carry forward any
profits.

      (C) In carrying  sums to reserve and in  applying  the same the  Directors
shall comply with the provisions of the Statutes.

THE SEAL

109 The Company may exercise the powers conferred by the Statutes with regard to
having an official  seal for use abroad and such  powers  shall be vested in the
Directors.

110 (A) The  Directors  shall  provide for the safe  custody of the Seal and any
Securities Seal and neither shall be used without the authority of the Directors
or of a committee authorised by the Directors in that behalf.

      (B) Every  instrument  to which the Seal shall be affixed  shall be signed
autographically  by one Director and the Secretary or by two Directors save that
as regards any  certificates for shares or debentures or other securities of the
Company the Directors may by resolution determine that such signatures or either
of them  shall  be  dispensed  with or  affixed  by some  method  or  system  of
mechanical signature.

      (C) The Securities Seal shall be used only for sealing  securities  issued
by the Company and documents  creating or evidencing  securities so issued.  Any
such  securities or documents  sealed with the Securities Seal shall not require
to be signed.

      (D) Where the Statutes so permit,  any  instrument  signed by one Director
and the  Secretary  or by two  Directors  and  expressed  to be  executed by the
Company shall have the same effect as if executed under the Seal,  provided that
no  instrument  shall be so signed  which  makes it clear on its face that it is
intended by the person or persons making it to have effect as a deed without the
authority of the Directors or of a committee authorised by the Directors in that
behalf.

DIVIDENDS

111 (A) The Company may by Ordinary  Resolution  declare  dividends  but no such
dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the Directors.

      (B) In the period to 31 December  2003,  the Directors  shall announce any
dividends on Ordinary Shares in US dollars  together with a sterling  equivalent
for any such  dividend  which shall be  determined  in  accordance  with Article
113(C) below.

      (C) Holders of Ordinary  Shares shall be entitled to be paid  dividends in
sterling.

                                       57
<PAGE>
112 If and so far as in the opinion of the  Directors the profits of the Company
justify such payments,  the Directors may declare and pay the fixed dividends on
any class of shares  carrying a fixed dividend  expressed to be payable on fixed
dates on the  half-yearly or other dates  prescribed for the payment thereof and
may also from time to time pay interim  dividends on shares of any class of such
amounts and on such dates and in respect of such periods as they think fit.

113 (A) Unless and to the extent that the rights  attached  to any  shares,  the
terms of issue thereof or these presents otherwise provide,  all dividends shall
(as regards any shares not fully paid  throughout the period in respect of which
the dividend is paid) be apportioned  and paid pro rata according to the amounts
paid on the shares  during any  portion or  portions of the period in respect of
which the dividend is paid. For the purposes of this Article no amount paid on a
share in advance of calls shall be treated as paid on the share.

      (B) The Directors  may at their  discretion  make  provisions to enable an
Approved Depositary and/or any other member to receive dividends duly payable in
a currency or currencies other than sterling.

      (C) For the  purposes  of the  calculation  of the  amount  receivable  in
respect  of any  dividend,  the rate of  exchange  to be used to  determine  the
relevant  currency  equivalent  of any sum  payable as a dividend  shall be such
market rate  (whether  spot or forward)  selected by the Directors as they shall
consider appropriate ruling at the close of business in London on the date which
is the business day last  preceding (a) in the case of a dividend to be declared
by the  Company in general  meeting,  the date on which the  Directors  publicly
announce their intention to recommend that specific dividend and

(b) in the case of any other dividend,  the date on which the Directors publicly
announce their intention to pay that specific dividend.  Provided that where the
Directors consider the circumstances to be appropriate they shall determine such
relevant  currency  equivalent of any sums payable as a dividend by reference to
such market rate or rates or the mean of such market  rates  prevailing  at such
time or times or on such other date or dates,  in each case  falling  before the
time of the relevant  announcement,  as the  Directors  may in their  discretion
select.

114 No  dividend  shall be paid  otherwise  than out of  profits  available  for
distribution under the provisions of the Statutes.

115 Subject to the  provisions  of the  Statutes,  where any asset,  business or
property  is bought by the  Company as from a past date the  profits  and losses
thereof as from such date may at the  discretion of the Directors in whole or in
part be carried to revenue  account and  treated for all  purposes as profits or
losses of the Company.  Subject as aforesaid,  if any shares or  securities  are
purchased  cum  dividend or  interest,  such  dividend  or  interest  may at the
discretion  of  the  Directors  be  treated  as  revenue,  and it  shall  not be
obligatory to capitalise the same or any part thereof.

116 No dividend or other  moneys  payable on or in respect of a share shall bear
interest as against the Company.

117 (A) The Directors  may retain any dividend or other moneys  payable on or in
respect of a share on which the  Company has a lien and may apply the same in or
towards  satisfaction  of the debts,  liabilities  or  engagements in respect of
which the lien exists.

      (B) The Directors may retain the dividends  payable upon shares in respect
of which any person is under the  provisions  as to the  transmission  of shares
hereinbefore contained entitled to become a member, or which any person is under
those provisions  entitled to transfer,  until such person shall become a member
in respect of such shares or shall transfer the same.

118 The waiver in whole or in part of any  dividend on any share by any document
(whether or not under seal) shall be effective  only if such  document is signed
by the  shareholder  (or the person  entitled to the share in consequence of the
death or bankruptcy of the holder) and delivered to the Company and if or to the
extent that the same is accepted as such or acted upon by the Company.

119 The payment by the  Directors  of any  unclaimed  dividend  or other  moneys
payable on or in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute
the Company a trustee in respect  thereof  and any  dividend  unclaimed  after a
period of twelve years from the date of  declaration  of such dividend  shall be
forfeited and shall revert to the Company.

                                       58
<PAGE>

120 The  Company  may upon  the  recommendation  of the  Directors  by  Ordinary
Resolution  direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution
of specific  assets (and in  particular  of paid-up  shares or debentures of any
other  company)  and the  Directors  shall give  effect to such  Resolution.  In
addition the Directors may direct payment of any dividend in whole or in part by
the  distribution  of  Designated  Shares.  If at any time and from time to time
there have been, or will be,  allotted any shares which are  Designated  Shares,
the Directors resolve to allot to any person any Ordinary Shares (whether or not
pursuant to an existing  obligation of the Company) the Directors may, if and so
far as in the opinion of the Directors  the profits of the Company  justify such
payments,  either  at the  time of such  allotment  or at any  time  thereafter,
resolve that there be paid to the registered  holder of such Ordinary  Shares as
at the close of business (or at such other time as the Directors may  determine)
on  such  date  as the  Directors  may  specify  a  dividend  to be  paid by the
distribution of Designated  Shares in such amount and manner as will secure that
such holder will receive one  Designated  Share for each Ordinary  Share held by
him. (If and so far as the  foregoing  provisions  are  inconsistent  with those
contained  in Articles  112,  113, 121 or 123, the  foregoing  provisions  shall
prevail.)  Where any  difficulty  arises in  regard  to such  distribution,  the
Directors  may settle the same as they think  expedient  and in  particular  may
issue  fractional  certificates,  may fix the  value  for  distribution  of such
specific  assets or any part thereof,  may determine that cash payments shall be
made to any  members  upon the  footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust
the rights of all parties and may vest any such  specific  assets in trustees as
may seem expedient to the  Directors.  The Directors may in relation to any such
distribution of Designated Shares authorise any person to enter on behalf of all
the members  interested into an agreement with the relevant Designed  Subsidiary
whereby  such  members  agree to become  members and to be bound,  in respect of
their  holdings of Designated  shares from time to time, by the  Memorandum  and
Articles of  Association  (as  amended  from time to time),  of such  Designated
Subsidiary  and each  mandate or other  instruction  relating  to the payment of
dividends or making of  distributions  by the Company,  and which is in force at
the time of determining  entitlement to any  distribution of Designated  Shares,
shall,  unless and until  revoked,  become a valid and binding  mandate or other
instruction  to such  Designated  Subsidiary in respect of any dividend or other
distribution  paid or made by it, and any  agreement  made  under the  authority
given to the  Directors  pursuant to this Article shall be effective and binding
on all concerned.

                                       59
<PAGE>

121 (A) Any  dividend or other  moneys  payable in cash  (whether in sterling or
foreign  currency  pursuant to  provision  made under these  presents)  on or in
respect of a share may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to the
registered  address  (or in the case of an Approved  Depositary,  subject to the
approval of the Directors,  such persons and addresses as an Approved Depositary
may direct) of the member or person entitled thereto (or, if two or more persons
are  registered  as joint  holders  of the  share  or are  entitled  thereto  in
consequence  of the  death  or  bankruptcy  of the  holder,  to any  one of such
persons) or to such person and such  address as such member or person or persons
may by writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall be made payable to, or
to the order of, the  person to whom it is sent or to such  person as the holder
or joint holders or person or persons  entitled to the share in  consequence  of
the death or  bankruptcy  of the holder may direct and  payment of the cheque or
warrant by the banker  upon whom it is drawn  shall be a good  discharge  to the
Company.  If any such  cheque or  warrant  has or shall be  alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed,  the Directors may, on request of the person entitled
thereto,  issue a replacement  cheque or warrant subject to compliance with such
conditions  as to  evidence  and  indemnity  and the  payment  of out of  pocket
expenses of the Company in  connection  with the  request as the  Directors  may
think fit.  Every such cheque or warrant shall be sent at the risk of the person
entitled to the money represented  thereby.  If on three  consecutive  occasions
cheques or warrants in payment of  dividends  or other  moneys  payable on or in
respect  of any share have been sent  through  the post in  accordance  with the
provisions of this Article but have been returned  undelivered  or left uncashed
during the periods for which the same are valid, the Company need not thereafter
despatch  further  cheques or warrants in payment of  dividends  or other moneys
payable  on or in  respect  of the share in  question  until the member or other
person entitled thereto shall have communicated with the Company and supplied in
writing to the Transfer Office an address for the purpose.

(B) Where an Approved  Depositary  approved by the Directors for the purposes of
this  Article  has  elected or agreed  pursuant  to  provision  made under these
presents to receive dividends in a foreign currency,  the Directors may in their
discretion  approve  the  entering  into  of  arrangements  with  such  Approved
Depositary  to  enable  payment  of the  dividend  to be made  to such  Approved
Depositary in such foreign  currency for value on the date on which the relevant
dividend is paid, or such later date as the Directors may determine.

122 If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any share,  or are
entitled  jointly to a share in  consequence  of the death or  bankruptcy of the
holder,  any one of them may give  effectual  receipts for any dividend or other
moneys payable or property distributable on or in respect of the share.

RECORD DATE

123  Notwithstanding any other provision of these presents but subject always to
the Statutes,  the Company or the  Directors may by resolution  specify any date
(the "record  date") as the date at the close of business (or such other time as
the  Directors  may  determine)  on which  persons  registered as the holders of
shares  or other  securities  shall be  entitled  to  receipt  of any  dividend,
distribution,  interest,  allotment,  issue,  notice,  information,  document or
circular  and such record date may be on or at any time before the date on which
the  same  is paid or  made  or (in  the  case  of any  dividend,  distribution,
interest,  allotment  or  issue)  at any time  after  the  same is  recommended,
resolved,  declared or announced but without prejudice to the rights inter se in
respect of the same of transferors  and  transferees of any such shares or other
securities.

CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS AND RESERVES

124 The  Directors  may,  with the  sanction  of an Ordinary  Resolution  of the
Company,  capitalise  any sum  standing  to the  credit of any of the  Company's
reserve  accounts  (including  any share  premium  account,  capital  redemption
reserve or other  undistributable  reserve) or any sum standing to the credit of
profit and loss account by appropriating  such sum to the members who would have
been  entitled to it if it were  distributed  by way of dividend on the Ordinary
Shares and in the same  proportions  and  applying  such sum on their  behalf in
paying up in full unissued  Ordinary  Shares (or,  subject to any special rights
previously conferred on any shares or class of shares for the time being issued,
unissued  shares of any other class not being  redeemable  shares) for allotment
and  distribution  credited as fully paid up to and amongst them as bonus shares
in  the  proportions  aforesaid.  The  Directors  may  do all  acts  and  things
considered  necessary or  expedient  to give effect to any such  capitalisation,
with full power to the  Directors to make such  provisions as they think fit for
any fractional  entitlements which would arise on the basis aforesaid (including
provisions as to the date or dates by reference to which the entitlement of such
members is to be determined and provisions whereby  fractional  entitlements are
disregarded  or the benefit  thereof  accrues to the Company  rather than to the
members concerned). The Directors may authorise any person to enter on behalf of
all the members  interested into an agreement with the Company providing for any
such  capitalisation and matters incidental thereto and any agreement made under
such authority shall be effective and binding on all concerned.

                                       60

ACCOUNTS

125 Accounting records sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions
and otherwise  complying  with the Statutes  shall be kept at the Office,  or at
such  other  place as the  Directors  think  fit,  and  shall  always be open to
inspection by the officers of the Company. Subject as aforesaid no member of the
Company or other person shall have any right of  inspecting  any account or book
or document of the Company  except as conferred by statute or ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction or authorised by the Directors.

126 A copy of every  balance  sheet and profit and loss  account  which is to be
laid before a General Meeting of the Company  (including every document required
by law to be comprised  therein or attached or annexed  thereto)  shall not less
than  twenty-one days before the date of the meeting be sent to every member of,
and every holder of debentures  of, the Company and to every other person who is
entitled to receive notices of meetings from the Company under the provisions of
the Statutes or of these presents.  Provided that this Article shall not require
a copy of these documents to be sent to more than one of joint holders or to any
person of whose  address the  Company is not aware,  but any member or holder of
debentures to whom a copy of these documents has not been sent shall be entitled
to  receive a copy free of charge on  application  at the  Office  and  provided
further that if the Statutes so permit the Company need not send copies of these
documents  to  members  who do not wish to  receive  them but may send them such
summary  financial  statement  or other  documents as may be  authorised  by the
Statutes. So long as and whenever any of the shares or debentures of the Company
are for the time being  listed or dealt in on the London Stock  Exchange,  there
shall be forwarded to the appropriate  officer of the London Stock Exchange such
number of copies of such  documents as may for the time being be required  under
its regulations or practice.

AUDITORS

127  Subject  to the  provisions  of the  Statutes,  all acts done by any person
acting as an Auditor  shall,  as regards all persons  dealing in good faith with
the  Company,  be  valid,  notwithstanding  that  there  was some  defect in his
appointment  or that he was at the time of his  appointment  not  qualified  for
appointment or subsequently become disqualified.

128 An Auditor  shall be entitled  to attend any General  Meeting and to receive
all notices of and other  communications  relating to any General  Meeting which
any member is entitled to receive and to be heard at any General  Meeting on any
part of the business of the meeting which concerns him as Auditor.

NOTICES

129 (A) Any notice or document  (including a share certificate) may be served on
or delivered  to any member by the Company  either  personally  or by sending it
through  the post in a  prepaid  cover  (in  such  form as any  Director  or the
Secretary may determine)  addressed to such member at his registered address, or
(if he has no registered  address within the United Kingdom) to the address,  if
any, within the United Kingdom supplied by him to the Company as his address for
the  service of  notices,  or by  delivering  it to such  address  addressed  as
aforesaid.  In the case of a member  registered  on a branch  register  any such
notice  or  document  may be  posted  either  in the  United  Kingdom  or in the
territory in which such branch  register is  maintained.  The Directors may also
determine,  subject  to the  provisions  of the  Statutes,  that any  notice  or
document  (excluding a share  certificate)  may be served on or delivered to any
member by the Company either by facsimile to a facsimile  number supplied by him
to the Company or by electronic mail to an electronic address supplied by him to
the Company.

      (B) Where a notice or other document is served or sent by post, service or
delivery shall be deemed to be effected at the  expiration of twenty-four  hours
(or, where second-class mail is employed, forty-eight hours) after the time when
the cover  containing the same is posted and in proving such service or delivery
it shall be sufficient to prove that such cover was properly addressed,  stamped
and posted. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes and these presents,  where
a notice or other document is sent by electronic  mail or by facsimile,  service
or delivery  shall be deemed to be effected at the  expiration of two hours from
the time of transmission.

                                       61
<PAGE>
130 Any  notice  given to that one of the joint  holders  of a share  whose name
stands  first in the  Register  of  Members  in  respect  of the share  shall be
sufficient  notice to all the joint holders in their  capacity as such. For such
purpose a joint holder  having no registered  address in the United  Kingdom and
not having  supplied  an address  within the United  Kingdom  for the service of
notices shall be disregarded.

131 A person  entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a
member  upon  supplying  to the  Company  such  evidence  as the  Directors  may
reasonably  require to show his title to the share,  and upon  supplying also an
address within the United Kingdom for the service of notices,  shall be entitled
to have served upon or  delivered  to him at such address any notice or document
to which the member but for his death or  bankruptcy  would have been  entitled,
and such  service or  delivery  shall for all  purposes  be deemed a  sufficient
service  or  delivery  of such  notice or  document  on all  persons  interested
(whether jointly with or as claiming through or under him) in the share. Save as
aforesaid  any notice or  document  delivered  or sent by post to or left at the
address of any member in pursuance of these presents shall, notwithstanding that
such member be then dead or bankrupt or in  liquidation,  and whether or not the
Company have notice of his death or bankruptcy or liquidation, be deemed to have
been duly served or delivered in respect of any share  registered in the name of
such member as sole or first-named joint holder.

132 A member who (having no registered  address  within the United  Kingdom) has
not supplied to the Company an address within the United Kingdom for the service
of notices  shall not be entitled to receive  notices  from the  Company.  If on
three  consecutive  occasions  notices  have been sent  through  the post to any
member at his  registered  address or his address for the service of notices but
have been returned undelivered,  such member shall not thereafter be entitled to
receive  notices  from the  Company  until he shall have  communicated  with the
Company and supplied in writing to the Transfer Office a new registered  address
or address within the United Kingdom for the service of notices.

133 If at any time by reason of the suspension or curtailment of postal services
within the United Kingdom the Company is unable effectively to convene a General
Meeting by notices sent through the post, a General Meeting may be convened by a
notice advertised on the same date in at least two leading daily newspapers with
appropriate circulation and such notice shall be deemed to have been duly served
on all  members  entitled  thereto  at noon on the day  when  the  advertisement
appears.  In any such case the  Company  shall send  confirmatory  copies of the
notice by post if at least  seven  days  prior to the  meeting  the  posting  of
notices to addresses throughout the United Kingdom again becomes practicable.

134 Nothing in any of the preceding five Articles  shall affect any  requirement
of the Statutes that any particular offer, notice or other document be served in
any particular manner.

WINDING UP

135 The  Directors  shall have power in the name and on behalf of the Company to
present a petition to the Court for the Company to be wound up.

136 If the Company  shall be wound up (whether  the  liquidation  is  voluntary,
under  supervision or by the Court) the Liquidator may, with the authority of an
Extraordinary  Resolution,  divide among the members in specie or kind the whole
or any part of the assets of the  Company  and  whether or not the assets  shall
consist of  property of one kind or shall  consist of  properties  of  different
kinds,  and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any one or
more class or classes of property and may determine  how such division  shall be
carried  out as  between  the  members or  different  classes  of  members.  The
Liquidator may, with the like authority, vest any part of the assets in trustees
upon such  trusts for the  benefit of  members as the  Liquidator  with the like
authority  shall think fit, and the liquidation of the Company may be closed and
the Company dissolved,  but so that no contributory shall be compelled to accept
any shares or other property in respect of which there is a liability.

INDEMNITY

137  Subject  to the  provisions  of and so far as may be  consistent  with  the
Statutes,  every  Director,  Auditor,  Secretary or other officer of the Company
shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company  against all costs,  charges,
losses,  expenses  and  liabilities  incurred  by him in  the  execution  and/or
discharge of his duties  and/or the exercise of his powers  and/or  otherwise in
relation to or in connection with his duties, powers or office.

CO-CHAIRMAN

138   (A)   The Directors may appoint one of their number as
Co-Chairman  on such terms as they may determine and the  provisions of Articles
51, 78 and 95 shall apply to any person so appointed  and  references  herein to
Chairman shall be construed to mean Co-Chairman, or any one of them.

      (B) For so long as there are  Co-Chairmen,  the  Chairman  to preside at a
meeting of the  Directors  or of the Company  shall be  determined  by agreement
between them, or if no such agreement can be reached, by the Directors present.

SHARE WARRANTS

139 Subject to the Statutes and Articles 140 to 144, the Company with respect to
any fully-paid shares may issue to such persons as the Directors may decide (the
"Bearer")  share  warrants to bearer ("Share  Warrants")  under the Seal stating
that the Bearer is entitled to the shares therein  specified and may provide (by
coupons or  otherwise)  for the payment or making of future  dividends  or other
distributions, and the issue of shares pursuant to Article 124, on or in respect
of the shares included in such Share Warrants.

140 A Share Warrant shall entitle the Bearer thereof to the shares  specified in
it, and the shares  represented  by it may be transferred by the delivery of the
Share Warrant,  and the  provisions of these  presents  (other than this Article
140) with  respect to the  transfer  and  transmission  of shares  and  untraced
shareholders shall not apply thereto.

141  (A) The  Directors  shall  be  entitled  (but  not  obliged)  to  accept  a
certificate  (in such form as the Directors  may approve) of the ADR  Depositary
(as  hereinafter  defined),  or of any bank or agent of the  Company,  that such
banks,  agent or the ADR Depositary holds a specified Share Warrant on behalf of
the person named in the  certificate as sufficient  evidence of the facts stated
in such  certificate  including  the number of shares  specified  in it, and may
treat the deposit of such  certificate  at the Transfer  Office as equivalent to
the deposit there of the Share Warrant for the purposes of these  presents other
than in relation to Article 144.

      (B) The expression "ADR Depositary" shall mean a custodian or other person
or persons appointed from time to time by the Company to hold Share Warrants.

142   The Share Warrants shall be subject to the following conditions:-

      (i) Except as otherwise  provided in sub-paragraph  (vii) of this Article,
no Share  Warrant shall be issued except upon a request in writing by the person
for the time being named in the  Register of Members as the holder of the shares
in respect of which the Share Warrant is to be issued.  The Directors  shall not
be under any obligation to accede to any such request.

      (ii) The request shall be in such form,  and supported by such evidence as
to the  identity of the person  making the same and of his right or title to the
shares, as the Directors shall from time to time require, and shall be lodged at
the Transfer Office.

      (iii) Before the issue of a Share Warrant the share  certificates (if any)
then  outstanding  in respect of the shares to be included in the Share  Warrant
shall be delivered up to the Company for cancellation.

      (iv) Save as otherwise agreed by the Company,  any person applying to have
a Share Warrant issued shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify the Company
against,  any stamp  duties,  stamp duty reserve tax,  bearer  instrument  duty,
taxes, charges,  fees, interest and penalties payable (if any) in respect of the
issue of the Share  Warrant  and shall  pay to the  Company  at the time of such
issue such amount in respect thereof as the Company may require.

      (v) Each Share  Warrant  shall  represent  such number of shares and be in
such language and form as the Directors shall think fit.

      (vi) The Company  shall be entitled to recognise an absolute  right in the
Bearer for the time being of any Share  Warrant to such  amount of  dividend  or
other  moneys  payable on or in respect  of the  shares  included  in such Share
Warrant,  as  shall  have  been  declared  or  otherwise  be  payable,  upon the
presentation  or delivery of such Share Warrant,  and payment by or on behalf of
the Company to an account or accounts  specified by the person  presenting  such
Share Warrant to the Transfer Office against such presentation or delivery shall
be a good discharge to the Company accordingly.

      (vii) Save as otherwise  agreed by the Company,  subject to the payment to
the  Company  of all (if any)  stamp  duties,  stamp duty  reserve  tax,  bearer
instrument duty, taxes, charges,  fees, interest and penalties which may thereby
be involved and for which the Company may be required to account:-

      (a) if any Share  Warrant is worn out,  damaged or defaced,  a replacement
Share  Warrant will be issued upon  request and upon  surrender of the old Share
Warrant for cancellation;

                                       63
<PAGE>
      (b) if any  Share  Warrant  is  alleged  to  have  been  lost,  stolen  or
destroyed,  a replacement Share Warrant may, at the discretion of the Directors,
be issued to the person  claiming to be entitled  thereto  upon request and upon
compliance  with such conditions as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of
out-of-pocket  expenses  of the  Company in  connection  with the request as the
Directors  may think fit  provided  that no new Share  Warrant  may be issued to
replace  one that has been  lost  unless  the  Directors  are  satisfied  beyond
reasonable doubt that the original has been destroyed; and

      (c)   a Bearer may surrender for cancellation
any Share  Warrant and request that the Company  issue in lieu two or more Share
Warrants which together  represent the same shares in such  proportion as he may
specify and the Directors may, if they think fit,  authorise the cancellation of
the original Share Warrants and the issuance of such new Share Warrants.

      (viii) A Bearer may at any time deposit the Share Warrant  together with a
written  declaration  specifying  his  name  and  address  at such  place as the
Directors may from time to time appoint (or, in default of such appointment,  at
the Transfer  Office),  and, so long as the Share Warrant  remains so deposited,
the depositor  shall have the same right of signing a requisition  for calling a
meeting of the Company,  of giving notice of intention to submit a resolution to
a meeting,  of attending  and voting,  giving a proxy and  exercising  the other
rights and privileges of a member at any meeting held after the expiration of 48
hours from the time of  deposit,  as if from the time of  deposit  his name were
inserted in the Register as the holder of the shares  specified in the deposited
Share Warrant.  Not more than one person shall be recognised as depositor of any
Share  Warrant.  Every  Share  Warrant  which  shall have been so  deposited  as
aforesaid  shall  remain so  deposited  until  after the close of the meeting at
which the depositor  desires to attend or to be  represented.  Save as otherwise
expressly  provided,  no person shall, as bearer of a Share Warrant, be entitled
to sign a requisition for calling a General Meeting.

      (ix)  Subject as  otherwise  expressly  provided in Articles 139 to 144, a
Bearer  (or  the  depositor  of a  Share  Warrant  in  accordance  with  Article
142(viii)) shall be entitled in all other respects to the same rights, benefits,
privileges and advantages, accorded from time to time pursuant to these presents
or by the  Statutes  (subject  to  these  presents)  and  subject  to  the  same
obligations  and duties as if he were named in the Register as the holder of the
shares specified in the Share Warrant,  and he shall be deemed to be a member of
the Company for these purposes.

143 (A) In the case of an offer of shares,  securities  or debentures to members
or any class of members,  or a proposed issue of shares pursuant to Article 124,
it shall be sufficient, so far as any Bearer is concerned, to advertise the fact
of the proposed  offer or issue once in a leading  London daily  newspaper,  and
such other newspapers (if any) as the Directors may from time to time determine,
and upon the Bearer  depositing  the Share  Warrant  (or,  if  appropriate,  the
requisite  coupon)  at the  Transfer  Office,  or some  other  place  or  places
mentioned in the  advertisement,  within the time limit prescribed in the offer,
he shall have the same right to receive  the offer and accept the  proportionate
number of shares,  securities or debentures  within the time limit prescribed in
the offer, or to participate in the proposed issue of shares pursuant to Article
124, as if he were the  registered  holder of the shares  comprised in the Share
Warrant.

      (B)   In the case of any notice or document or other
communication with members or any class of members,  it shall be sufficient,  so
far as any Bearer is  concerned,  to  advertise  the  notice,  document or other
communication  once  in  a  leading  London  daily  newspaper,  and  such  other
newspapers (if any) as the Directors may from time to time determine, and giving
an address where copies of the notice,  document or other  communication  may be
obtained by any Bearer.

144 If a Bearer shall desire to surrender a Share Warrant and be registered as a
member or request that another  person be  registered  as a member in respect of
all or any of the shares included in such Share Warrant,  he shall lodge at such
place as the  Directors  may from time to time  appoint  (or, in default of such
appointment,  at the Transfer  Office) for  cancellation  of such Share  Warrant
together  with  a  declaration  in  writing  signed  by  him in  such  form  and
authenticated  in such manner as the  Directors  may require,  requesting  to be
registered as a member in respect of all or some of the shares specified in such
Share Warrant and stating in such declaration his full name and address. Save as
otherwise agreed by the Company, upon the payment to the Company of all (if any)
stamp duties,  stamp duty reserve tax, bearer instrument duty,  taxes,  charges,
fees, interest and penalties which may thereby be incurred by the Company or for
which the Company is required to  account,  the person  giving such  declaration
shall thereupon be entitled to have his name entered as a member in the Register
in respect of the relevant shares  specified in the Share Warrant so surrendered
and to receive a share  certificate  therefor.  If the Bearer shall desire to be
registered  as a member in respect of part only of the shares  included  in such
Share Warrant,  a Share Warrant for the balance of the shares shall be issued to
such  person  without  charge  upon   cancellation   of  the  Share  Warrant  so
surrendered.

APPROVED DEPOSITARIES

145 Without  prejudice  to the right of an Approved  Depositary  to exercise any
rights  conferred  hereinbefore  in these presents,  an Approved  Depositary may
appoint as its proxy or proxies  such person or persons as it thinks fit and may
determine the method by which,  and the terms on which,  such  appointments  are
made,  save that each such  appointment  shall  specify  the number of  Ordinary
Shares in respect of which the  appointment is made and the aggregate  number of
Ordinary Shares in respect of which  appointments  subsist at any one time shall
not exceed the aggregate  number of Ordinary  Shares (such  aggregate  number of
Ordinary Shares for the time being hereinafter  called "the Depositary  Shares")
which for the time being shall either:-

      (i)   be registered in the name of the Approved Depositary or its nominee;
or

      (ii)  be represented by Share Warrants which
have been  deposited  by or on behalf of the  Approved  Depositary  pursuant  to
Article  142(viii) or are the subject  matter of a  certificate  accepted by the
Directors pursuant to Article 141(A).

146 The Approved  Depositary  shall maintain a register or system(s) ("the Proxy
Register")  in  which  shall be  recorded  such  details  as the  Directors  may
determine  of each  person  who is for the time  being so  appointed  as a proxy
pursuant to Article  145 (an  "Appointed  Proxy")  and the number of  Depositary
Shares (his "Appointed Number") in respect of which his appointment for the time
being  subsists.  The Proxy  Register  shall be open to inspection by any person
authorised  by  the  Company  during  usual  business  hours  and  the  Approved
Depositary  shall  furnish to the  Company or its  agents  upon  demand all such
information as to the contents of the Proxy Register,  or any part of it, as may
be requested.

147 Subject to the Statutes and subject to the provisions of these presents, and
so long as the  Depositary  Shares  shall  be of a  sufficient  number  so as to
include his Appointed Number, an Appointed Proxy:-

      (i) shall upon  production to the Company at a General  Meeting of written
evidence of his appointment  (which shall be in such form as the Company and the
Approved  Depositary  shall determine from time to time) be entitled to the same
rights,  and subject to the same  restrictions,  in  relation  to his  Appointed
Number of the  Depositary  Shares as though such shares were  registered  in the
name of the Appointed Proxy and he were a person  appointed as proxy pursuant to
an instrument of proxy duly signed by the Approved Depositary in accordance with
Article  67(A) and left at the  Transfer  Office (or at such other  place as may
have been  specified for the purpose in accordance  with Article 67(A)) not less
than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Directors may  determine)  before the
time appointed for the meeting (or adjourned  meeting) or (in the case of a poll
taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting or adjourned  meeting)
for the taking of the poll at which it is to be used;

      (ii) shall  himself be entitled,  by an instrument of proxy duly signed by
him  pursuant  to  Article  67(A),  to  appoint  another  person as his proxy in
relation  to  his  Appointed  Number  of  Depositary  Shares,  and so  that  the
provisions of these presents  shall apply  (mutatis  mutandis) in relation to an
instrument  signed  pursuant  to this  paragraph  (ii) of this  article and to a
person  appointed  pursuant  to such an  instrument  as though  such shares were
registered in the name of the Appointed  Proxy and the instrument were a form of
proxy signed by the Appointed Proxy in accordance with Article 67(A); and

      (iii)  shall be entitled to  exercise  all other  rights  capable of being
exercised  in  relation  to a  General  Meeting  by a person  who has  deposited
pursuant to Article  142(viii) (and has left on such deposit) a Share Warrant or
Share  Warrants  representing  Ordinary  Shares  of a number  equivalent  to his
Appointed Number.

148 The  Company may send to the  Appointed  Proxies as  appearing  in the Proxy
Register at their  addresses  as so  appearing  all notices and other  documents
which are sent to the holders of Ordinary Shares.

149 The  Company  may pay to an  Appointed  Proxy at his address as shown in the
Proxy Register all dividends  payable on the Ordinary Shares in respect of which
he has been appointed as Appointed Proxy, and payment of any such dividend shall
be a good  discharge  to the Company of its  obligation  to make  payment to the
Approved Depositary in respect of the shares concerned.

150   (A)For the purposes of determining which persons are entitled as Appointed
Proxies:-

     (i)  to exercise the rights conferred by Article 147;

     (ii) to receive documents sent pursuant to Article 148; and

     (iii) to be paid dividends paid pursuant to Article 149,

      and the number of Depositary  Shares in respect of which a person is to be
treated as having been  appointed as an Appointed  Proxy for such  purpose,  the
Approved Depositary may determine that the Appointed Proxies who are so entitled
shall be the persons entered in the Proxy Register at the close of business on a
date (a "Record  Date")  determined by the Approved  Depositary in  consultation
with the Company.

                                       65
<PAGE>
      (B)   When a Record Date is determined for a particular purpose:-

      (i) the number of Depositary  Shares in respect of which a person  entered
in the Proxy  Register  as an  Appointed  Proxy is to be treated as having  been
appointed for that purpose shall be the number appearing against his name in the
Proxy Register as at the close of business on the Record Date; and

      (ii) changes to entries in the Proxy  Register after the close of business
on the Record Date shall be disregarded in  determining  the  entitlement of any
person for the purpose concerned.

151 Except as required by law, no  Appointed  Proxy shall be  recognised  by the
Company as holding  any  interest  in shares  upon any trust and  subject to the
recognition  of  the  rights  conferred  in  relation  to  General  Meetings  by
appointments  made by Appointed  Proxies pursuant to Article 147(ii) the Company
shall be  entitled  to treat any  person  entered  in the Proxy  Register  as an
Appointed Proxy as the only person (other than the Approved  Depositary) who has
any interest in the Ordinary  Shares in respect of which the Appointed Proxy has
been appointed.

152 If any question shall arise as to whether any  particular  person or persons
has or have been  validly  appointed  to vote (or  exercise  any other right) in
respect of any Depositary  Shares (whether by reason of the aggregate  number of
shares in respect  of which  appointments  are  recorded  in the Proxy  Register
exceeding  the aggregate  number of  Depositary  Shares or for any other reason)
such  question  shall if  arising  at or in  relation  to a General  Meeting  be
determined  by  the  chairman  of the  meeting  (and  if  arising  in any  other
circumstances shall be determined by the Directors) whose  determination  (which
may include  declining to recognise a particular  appointment or appointments as
valid)  shall if made in good faith be  conclusive  and  binding on all  persons
interested.

* with effect from the date upon which the agreement and plan of merger dated 31
March 1999 between BP Amoco,  ARCO and Prairie Holdings  becomes  unconditional,
the  Ordinary  share  capital of the Company will  increase to  US$9,000,000,000
