PART II - RULES 12b-25 (b) AND (c)

If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or
expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the
following should be completed. (Check box if appropriate)

(a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this
form could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or
expense;
[X]
(b) The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition
report on form 10-K, Form 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion
thereof will be filed in or before the fifteenth calendar day
following the prescribed due date; or the subject quarterly report
or transition report on Form 10-Q; or portion thereof will be filed
on or before the fifth calendar day following the prescribed due
date; and

(c) The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by rule
12b-25(c) has been attached if applicable.

	PART III - NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reason why Form 10-K and Form 10-KSB,
20-F, 11-K, 10-Q and Form 10-QSB, N-SAR, or the transition report or
portion thereof could not be filed within the prescribed period.

The Registrant had an expectation that the current accountant of record
would be completing the company's annual audit. Not until February 2001
did the company learn that Mr. William Butcher CPA would not be able to
complete the audit of the Registrant's December 31, 2000 financial
statements. The Registrant has filed a Form 8-K with respect to this
change in certifying accountants to complete the audit.  The Registrant
began immediately the process of contacting and interviewing prospective
accountants who could be engaged as certifying accountants to complete the
audit. Several of the prospective accountants, while interested in working
with the Registrant felt that there was not adequate time due to other
audit commitments and tax work already under way within their firms.  The
Registrant secured an engagement with Clevenger and Haywood, CPA on March
16, 2001 with respect to conducting an audit on the Registrant's December
31, 2000 financial statements. While Clevenger and Haywood have committed
considerable resources and the audit is progressing it is unreasonable to
expect them to conclude the audit and issue their opinion required to file
the Registrant's Form 10-KSB by the initial deadline of April 2, 2001.

The accountants and members of management are working diligently to
complete all aspects of the audit in a thorough and timely manner.

We are optimistic that we will be able to complete the process by the end
of the extension period but also recognize that this is a tremendous
effort to undertake in a very limited amount of time.

Dear Sirs:

I have read the Registrant's Form 12b-25 - Notification of Late Filing and
agree with the comments contained therein as they relate to
Clevenger & Haywood CPA. The late engagement of our firm as certifying
accountants, will not allow us to complete the audit and issue our opinion
on the December 31, 2000 financial statements prior to the initial
Form 10-KSB filing deadline of April 2, 2001 without unreasonable effort and
expense. We will make every effort to complete our audit and issue our opinion
on the financial statements to allow the Registrant to file its Form 10KSB
within the extension period.
