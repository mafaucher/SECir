A.    Operating Results

      To ensure the  development  of DSI,  DSI's  management  will  continue  to
      diversify  the  source  of  revenues  and  pursue  licensing  and  royalty
      agreements.  DSI now  concentrates  its  efforts  in the  improvement  and
      commercialization of gesture recognition  technology  applications for the
      human-machine interface.

      Fiscal  Quarter  Ended April 30, 2001  compared to the Quarter Ended April
      30, 2000

      Operations

      DSI officially  delivered the GRT enabled prototype to Netface LLC in June
      2001. DSI is continuing with the development of the GRT-enabled  products.

      Investment Income

      Investment and interest income was higher by $33,128 in the quarter ending
      April 30, 2001  ($38,959) as compared to the quarter ending April 30, 2000
      ($5,831).  Cash at April 30, 2001 ($2,597,754) was lower than at April 30,
      2000  ($4,192,616),  but the interest  income was lower as the cash in the
      second  quarter 2000 was from the private  placement that was completed at
      the end of April 2000 and thus did not earn interest for that quarter.

      Research and Development

      Total Research and Development  expenditure increased by $208,106 from the
      quarter ending April 30, 2000 ($111,272) as compared to the quarter ending
      April 30, 2001 ($111,272).  This increase was reflected in the increase in

      quarter  ending April,  2000 to $433,359 for the quarter  ending April 30,
      2001, an increase of $268,707. This increase was mainly due to:

      o     Salaries and  benefits  (increase  of  $106,000)  due to  additional
            employees being hired.

      o     Recruitment ($46,000) costs incurred to hire the additional staff.

      o     Investor   relations,   promotions  and   shareholders   information
            (increase of $28,000).  Investor  Relations  costs increased for the
            quarter  ending  April 30, 2001 due to the  payment to a  consulting
            firm for handling of the investor relations functions.

      o     Legal and accounting (increase of $17,000).

      o     Travel (increase of $37,000), which included travel to within Canada
            and to the US to  pursue  additional  financing  and  travel  by the
            Quebec staff to the Vancouver facilities.

      o     Rent and other expenses (increase of $35,000).

      Total  research and  development  expenditure  increased from $465,897 for
      fiscal 1999 to $498,382 for fiscal 2000,  an increase of 7%. There will be
      a substantial increase in the research and development expenditure for the
      year ending October 31, 2001 ("Fiscal 2001")for the further development of
      the acceptable prototype for the option agreements.

      The major increase was in salaries which  increased by $97,878 from fiscal
      1999  ($279,813)  to  fiscal  2000  ($377,691)  as there  were  additional
      engineers hired in the 2000 fiscal year.

      General and Administrative

      General and  administrative  expenses  increased  from $670,143 for fiscal
      1999 to $1,034,036  for fiscal 2000, an increase of $363,893  (54%).  This
      increase is mainly due to:

      o     Management  Fee - increase  of  $101,800  was  partially  due to the
            change in management during the fiscal 2000.

      o     Investor  Relations and Promo - increase of $19,720 due to fees paid
            for identifying investors in Europe.

      o     Consulting  Fees - increase of $85,446.  The increase was mostly due
            to hiring of consultant for  recruitment and office plan for the new
            location.

      o     Legal and  accounting - increase of $33,270 which  included fees for
            stating the  financials  in US GAAP and legal  counsel for financing
            opportunities in the United States.

      o     Travel and  accommodation  increased by $38,426 which was mainly due
            to travel to Europe and the US to pursue additional financing.

      o     Recruitment - $32,813. This was for advertising positions on the web
            and payment to recruiting agencies for hiring of employees.

      o     Telephone  - $11,685  increase  primarily  due to an increase in the
            cell phone usage.

      related expenses.

      In the fiscal 2000,  DSI's  primary  source of funds was from the issue of
      shares of common stock. DSI considers its operating cash flows and ability
      to raise equity capital as principal  indicators of its liquidity.  During
      the 2000,  DSI had cash inflow of $5 million  from  private  placement  of
      share  capital ($3.8  Million),  exercise of warrants  ($1.9  Million) and
      exercise of options ($437,000), leaving a cash balance at October 31, 2000
      of $4,079,315 compared to $64,000 at fiscal 1999. Although working capital
      is not  considered  to be an indicator of DSI's  liquidity,  DSI's working
      capital at end of fiscal 2000 was  $3,922,221,  an increase of  $4,088,777
      from fiscal 1999. In the fiscal 2000,  cash resources were utilized in the

      DSI believes that it has sufficient  cash on hand to meet its  anticipated
      requirements  at least through October 31, 2002. The funds will be used to
      meet DSI's  general  operating  expenses,  capital  needs for research and
      development and  obligations to the optionees of its technology.  DSI will
      require substantial additional funds for its product development programs,
      marketing and  distribution  and operating  expenses.  While management is
      pursuing  additional  financing,  DSI  currently  has no  commitments  for
      additional financing. Capital Requirements DSI raised $4,973,305 in equity
      during the fiscal  2000 from a number of private  placements,  exercise of

      DSI  believes  that  its  current  cash  position  will  provide  it  with
      sufficient  capital  to  meet  the  commitments  and  obligations  to  the
      optionees. The funds will be used to meet DSI's capital needs for research
      and development and for general and administrative purposes.

      The Management of DSI is pursuing larger scale financing  opportunities in
      Canada,  United States and Europe to commence the commercialization of its
      products. They are also in the process of identifying strategic allies and
      discussing with potential strategic  partnerships with the targeted market
      segments.

C.    Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.

      Research and Development

      As at October 31, 2000,  research and development costs accrued (exclusive
      of accumulated amortization) were $1,549,748, including $61,765 accrued in
      the most  current  year.  To support  the market  entry  product,  current
      research and development activities are focused on three areas:

            High-resolution multi-touch sensors adapted from touchpad technology
            used in many notebook computers.

            A  sensor-independent  proprietary  gesture  recognition  algorithm,
            which  can  be  used  with  a  variety  of  sensor  technologies.

      *     Application  interfaces aimed at and designed for professional users
            of high-end software applications like Adobe Photoshop, etc.

      The gesture recognition algorithm forms an engine, similar to an operating
      system, for gesture based human-machine interaction, and is the foundation
      for DSI's technology. This software will be designed to reside in a custom
      microchip. This approach will facilitate technology transfer and licensing
      to third parties, and ensure DSI's intellectual property protection.

      In  addition,  a Canadian  patent has been granted for  "Pointing  Gesture
      Method of Communication", based on US Patent 5,203,704.

D.    Trend Information

      DSI faces the general risk of  technology.  It received its first revenues
      in  the  fiscal   year  ended   October   31,   2000  from   signing   two
      license-to-option agreements with Netface LLC and Security Biometrics Inc.
      DSI plans to market its product  through forming  strategic  alliances and
      partnerships;  stand-alone  products to address the installed market base;
      and licensing agreements with major  software/hardware  original equipment
      manufacturers.
