B.  Liquidity and Capital Resources

    In the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000, DSI's primary source of funds was
    from the issue of Common Shares.  DSI considers its operating cash flows and
    ability to raise equity  capital as principal  indicators of its  liquidity.
    During the fiscal  year ended  October 31,  2000,  DSI had cash inflow of $5
    million from private placement of share capital ($3.8 Million),  exercise of
    warrants ($1.9 Million) and exercise of options  ($437,000),  leaving a cash
    balance at October 31, 2000 of $4,079,315 compared to $64,000 at October 31,
    1999. Although working capital is not considered to be an indicator of DSI's
    liquidity,  DSI's  working  capital at October 31, 2000 was  $3,922,221,  an
    increase  of  $4,088,777  from  October 31,  1999.  In the fiscal year ended
    October 31, 2000,  cash resources were utilized in the investment in gesture
    recognition  technology,  including  recruitment of additional employees the
    research  and  development  of  the  gesture  recognition  technology.   DSI
    relocated  to its new premises in October 2000 to provide more space for the
    engineers and the  laboratory.  Cash resources were utilized in the purchase
    of capital equipment such as furniture and computers.

    DSI has no long-term debt. Current liabilities of $212,679 included accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities, which decreased by $23,000 from October 31,
    1999.  DSI has  license-to-option  agreements  with Netface LLC and Security
    Biometrics Inc. DSI intends  primarily to meet its commitment to Netface and
    Security Biometrics while continuing to develop other product  applications.
    The funds  required  for this  purpose will be derived from its current cash
    position and possibly the issuance of common shares.

        warrant,  each full warrant exercisable to acquire one additional common
        share at $2.16 per share to April 20, 2002.

    DSI believes  that it has  sufficient  cash on hand to meet its  anticipated
    requirements  at least through  October 31, 2002.  The funds will be used to
    meet DSI's  general  operating  expenses,  capital  needs for  research  and
    development  and  obligations to the optionees of its  technology.  DSI will
    require substantial  additional funds for its product development  programs,
    marketing and  distribution  and  operating  expenses.  While  management is
    pursuing  additional  financing,   DSI  currently  has  no  commitments  for
    additional financing.

C.  Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.

    Research and Development

    As at October 31, 2000, research and development costs accrued (exclusive of
    accumulated amortization) were $1,549,748,  including $61,765 accrued in the
    most current year. To support the market entry product, current research and
    development activities are focused on three areas:

    o   High-resolution  multi-touch  sensors  adapted from touchpad  technology
        used in many  notebook  computers.

    o   A sensor-independent  proprietary gesture recognition  algorithm,  which
        can be used with a variety of sensor technologies.


                                       19
<PAGE>

    o   Application  interfaces aimed at and designed for professional  users of
        high-end software applications like Adobe Photoshop, etc.

    The gesture recognition  algorithm forms an engine,  similar to an operating
    system, for gesture based human-machine  interaction,  and is the foundation
    for DSI's  technology.  This software will be designed to reside in a custom
    microchip.  This approach will facilitate  technology transfer and licensing
    to third parties, and ensure DSI's intellectual property protection.

    In addition, a Canadian patent has been granted for "Pointing Gesture Method
    of Communication", based on US Patent 5,203,704.

D.  Trend Information

    DSI faces the general risk of technology.  It received its first revenues in
    the fiscal year ended  October 31, 2000 from  signing two  license-to-option
    agreements with Netface LLC and Security Biometrics Inc. DSI plans to market
    its  product  through   forming   strategic   alliances  and   partnerships;
    stand-alone  products to address the  installed  market base;  and licensing
    agreements with major software/hardware original equipment manufacturers.
