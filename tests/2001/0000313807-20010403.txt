      During 2000 the Company  acquired  Atlantic  Richfield  Company (ARCO) and
Burmah  Castrol plc (Burmah  Castrol)  and the 18%  minority  interest in Vastar
Resources  Inc.  (Vastar),  a  subsidiary  of ARCO.  We also  purchased  most of
ExxonMobil's assets used by the fuels refining and marketing operation in Europe
and made a number of minor  acquisitions.  All these business  combinations have
been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.

      BP's results in 2000 reflect the inclusion of ARCO and Burmah  Castrol and
the full  consolidation  of the European fuels joint venture from April 14, July
7, and August 1, 2000 respectively.

      As well as reporting net income (profit after inventory  holding gains and
losses, calculated on a first-in,  first-out basis), and after exceptional items
(as defined by UK GAAP: profits and losses on sale and termination of operations
and fundamental  restructuring  costs), BP also reports results on a replacement
cost basis (excluding inventory holding gains and losses) and before exceptional
items.  In addition the Group  discloses  the amount and nature of special items
which  are  non-recurring  charges  and  credits  that  are  not  classified  as
exceptional  items  under UK  GAAP.  This is done in  order  to  provide  a more
comparable  basis to the results and disclosures of US companies and to indicate
underlying  trading  performance   undistorted  by  significant   restructuring,
integration  and other one-off  charges and credits.  Special  charges have been
significant  in 2000 and 1999.  The  discussion  below  addresses  each of these
various measures and disclosures.

       The trading  environment was strong in 2000, with high oil and gas prices
and  significantly  improved refining margins being partly offset by pressure on
marketing   margins  from  higher   product  costs  and  the  weaker   chemicals
environment, owing to high feedstock costs and a weak euro.

      In 2000,  replacement cost profit before exceptional items (which excludes
inventory  holding  gains and losses) was $11,214  million  compared with $5,330
million in 1999. The result for 2000 includes a  contribution  from ARCO for the
period from April  14,2000,  a  contribution  from Burmah Castrol for the period
from July 7, 2000 and reflects  the full  consolidation  of the  European  fuels
business from August  1,2000.  In addition to  exceptional  items (as identified
under UK GAAP),  these results include special charges of $1,994 million ($1,454
million after tax) in 2000 and $1,210  million ($876 million after tax) in 1999,
and  depreciation and amortization of $1,535 million (1999 nil) arising from the
fixed asset  revaluation  adjustment and goodwill  consequent  upon the ARCO and
Burmah  Castrol  acquisitions  in 2000.  The  special  items  in 2000  primarily
comprise ARCO,  Vastar and Burmah  Castrol  integration  costs,  rationalization
costs  following  the BP and Amoco  merger,  a  provision  against  the  Group's
chemicals investment in Indonesia,  environmental charges and asset write-downs.
The major  components  of the special  charges in 1999 were  integration  costs,
costs  associated with the  restructuring  programme,  write-downs in respect of
asset  impairments  and  project  costs in respect of  process  improvement  and
outsourcing.

      The replacement cost operating profit for 2000 reflects the strong trading
environment,  together with the benefits of recent integration and restructuring
and productivity improvements.  Included in this result are estimated amounts of
$569 million  ($1,193  million after  ajusting for special  items) in respect of
ARCO,  $182 million in respect of the purchased  interest in the European  fuels
joint  venture,  and a loss of $125 million (loss of $7 million after  adjusting
for special items) in respect of Burmah Castrol,  representing  their respective
operating results since their dates of acquisition.

       Reductions in the combined cost  structure of BP, ARCO and Burmah Castrol
are  proceeding   according  to  plan,   with  the  achievement  of  $2  billion
year-on-year reductions in 2000.

       The  historical  cost  profit  for 2000  was  $11,870  million  including
inventory  holding gains of $728 million.  This compares with a profit of $5,008
million in 1999 after inventory holding gains of $1,728 million.  There were net
exceptional  gains of $220  million  (loss  of $72  million  after  tax) in 2000
compared with net  exceptional  losses in 1999 of $2,280 million ($2,050 million
after tax).

(a)   Includes special items of $624 million and $118 million incurred  directly
      by ARCO and Burmah Castrol respectively.

      The return on average capital employed (ROACE),  based on replacement cost
profit before exceptional items, was 16% (17% after adjusting for special items)
compared with 12% (13% after adjusting for special items) in 1999.  Owing to the
significant acquisitions that have taken place during the year, the annual ROACE
for 2000 has been  calculated  as the  average  of the four  discrete  quarterly
ROACEs.

      The  acquisitions  of ARCO  and  Burmah  Castrol  in 2000,  increased  our
employee   numbers  by   approximately   25,000.   Following   integration   and
rationalization  activities  4,000  employees are likely to leave the Group,  of
which 3,000 had left by the end of 2000. In 1999, following the merger of BP and
Amoco,  some 16,000  employees  left the Group through  severance or outsourcing
arrangements, a further 3,000 employees left in 2000. Of these, some 14,000 were
based in the USA.  The  reductions  arose  mainly in  Houston,  Texas;  Chicago,
Illinois; and Cleveland and Warrensville, Ohio.

       In 1999, replacement cost profit before exceptional items (which excludes
inventory  holding  gains and losses) was $5,330  million  compared  with $3,959
million in 1998,  representing  an increase  of 35%. In addition to  exceptional
items (as identified under UK GAAP),  these results included net special charges
of $1,210  million  ($876  million  after  tax) in 1999 and $597  million  ($469
million after tax) in 1998. The major  components of the special charges in 1999
were  integration  costs,  costs  associated with the  restructuring  programme,
write-downs  in respect of asset  impairments  and  project  costs in respect of
process  improvement  and  outsourcing.  The special  charges in 1998  consisted
principally of write-downs in respect of asset impairments.  After adjusting for
these  special  charges,  the 1999 result was 40% higher than that of 1998.  The
return on average  capital  employed,  based on  replacement  cost profit before
exceptional items, was 12% (13% after adjusting for special items)  representing
an increase of three percentage points over 1998.

       The  historical  cost  profit  for  1999  was  $5,008  million  including
inventory holding gains of $1,728 million. This compared with a profit of $3,220
million in 1998 after inventory holding losses of $1,391 million. There were net
exceptional losses of $2,280 million ($2,050 million after tax) in 1999 compared
with net exceptional profits in 1998 of $850 million ($652 million after tax).

      Owing to the significant acquisitions that took place in 2000, in addition
to its reported  results BP is presenting pro forma results adjusted for special
items in order to enable  shareholders  to  assess  current  performance  in the
context of our past  performance  and against that of our  competitors.  The pro
forma  result,  adjusted  for special  items,  has been derived from our UK GAAP
accounting information but is not in itself a recognized UK or US GAAP measure.

(a)   Excludes $27,506 million for the ARCO acquisition.

      Capital  expenditure  and  acquisitions  (excluding  the  cost of the ARCO
acquisition)  in 2000 amounted to $20,107  million.  Excluding the cost of other
significant  one-off cash  investments and  expenditure by acquired  businesses,
capital  expenditure  was $8,937 million in 2000 compared with $6,945 million in
1999.  Capital  expenditure in 1999 reflected reduced  investment at the time of
the BP and  Amoco  merger.  Capital  expenditure  in 2001 is likely to be around
$12-13  billion.  This is consistent  with historic levels of investment for the
enlarged group. By focusing on the better investment  opportunities,  this level
of expenditure  will permit growth  investment in Exploration  and Production to
enable the  business to achieve  targeted  production  growth of at least 5.5% a
year over the next five years (against an end 2000 baseline).

      The total dividends announced for 2000 were $4,625 million, against $3,884
million in 1999.  Dividends  per share for 2000 were 20.50 cents,  compared with
20.00  cents per share in 1999,  an increase  of 2.5%.  The  Company  intends to
continue to pay  dividends in the future of around 50% of our  replacement  cost
profit  before   exceptional   items  after  adjusting  for  special  items  and
acquisition amortization, adjusted to mid-cycle business conditions. Acquisition
amortization  refers to  depreciation  relating to the fixed  asset  revaluation
adjustment  and  amortization  of goodwill  consequent  upon the ARCO and Burmah
Castrol  acquisitions.  Mid-cycle  conditions  are our best  estimate  of likely
average prices and margins over the long term.

       The  Company  also  intends to continue  the  operation  of the  Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan (DRIP) for shareholders who wish to receive their dividend in
the form of shares rather than cash.  The BP Amoco Direct Access Plan for US and
Canadian investors also includes a dividend reinvestment feature.

      After approval at the annual general meeting in April 2000 for the Company
to repurchase its own shares, a total of 222 million shares were repurchased and
cancelled  in 2000 at a cost of $2 billion.  Further  repurchases  of 60 million
shares at a cost of $500 million were made during the first quarter of 2001. The
company will seek approval from  shareholders  at the April 2001 annual  general
meeting to continue  repurchasing  shares. The approval would allow shares to be
bought back as and when the Group's funding position permits.

Exceptional Items

      Following  completion  of the merger  between BP and Amoco on December 31,
1998 and in the context of low oil prices at the time,  BP undertook a strategic
and portfolio  review in early 1999.  This review was completed in the Spring of
1999 and resulted, among other things, in the development of an asset divestment
programme.  The guiding  principle of the strategic and portfolio  review was to
concentrate  the combined  Group's  operations on areas of competitive  strength
and, in the upstream portfolio, to dispose of assets which would not be robustly
economic on the basis of conservative  assumptions  about future oil and natural
gas prices.

      In 2000,  exceptional  items  consisting  of the profit or loss on sale of
fixed assets and  businesses and  termination  of operations,  were $220 million
before tax and  related  mainly to  disposal  profits on the sale of the Group's
common  interest in Altura  Energy,  the sale of the  Alliance  refinery and the
divestment of exploration and production  interests in Trinidad,  the UK and the
USA,  partially  offset  by the  loss  on sale of  certain  Venezuelan  upstream
interests  and on the  subvention of Singapore  Aromatics  Company bank loans in
connection  with the closure of our joint  venture.  The  disposals in 2000 were
part of the asset divestment programme.

       In 1999 the net exceptional losses of $2,280 million before tax comprised
restructuring  costs of $1,943 million and a net loss on sales of businesses and
fixed assets or  termination  of operations of $337 million.  The  restructuring
costs arose from restructuring activity across the Group following the merger of
BP and  Amoco at the end of 1998 and  relate  predominantly  to the  Group's  US
operations.  The main areas of activity were the  elimination  of duplication in
the former BP and Amoco  operations  and ongoing  restructuring  to adapt to the
changing business environment,  and some further outsourcing. The major elements
of the restructuring charges comprised employee severance costs ($1,212 million)
and  provisions  to cover future  rental  payments on surplus  leasehold  office
accommodation   and  other  property  ($297  million).   Also  included  in  the
restructuring  charges were office closure costs,  contract termination payments
and asset write-offs.  The cash outflow for these  restructuring  charges during
1999 was $976 million and in 2000 was $446 million.

       Sales  of  businesses  and  fixed  assets  in 1999  included  the sale of
distribution  terminals and service  stations in the USA mandated by the Federal
Trade  Commission  in connection  with the BP and Amoco  merger.  As part of the
asset divestment  programme,  the Group disposed of its Canadian oil properties,
its  interest in the  Pedernales  oil field in Venezuela  and certain  chemicals
operations.

      In 1998 sales of businesses and fixed assets  generated net profits before
tax of $1,048  million.  The principal  sales were  exploration  and  production
properties in the USA and Papua New Guinea, the refinery in Lima, Ohio, the sale
and leaseback of the Amoco building in Chicago,  Illinois, the retail network in
the  Czech  Republic,  the  Adibis  fuel  additives  business  and a  speciality
chemicals distribution business.  Also included was the disposal by the BP/Mobil
European  joint  venture of its retail  network in Belgium.  Merger  transaction
costs of $198 million in respect of advisers' fees and expenses were incurred in
1998.

Business Operating Results

      Total  replacement  cost  operating  profit,  which is  arrived  at before
inventory  holding  gains and losses,  interest  expense,  taxation and minority
interests,  and before  exceptional  items, was $17,756 million in 2000,  $8,894
million in 1999 and $6,521  million in 1998.  The business  results which follow
are presented on this basis.

      The  replacement  cost  operating  profit  for  2000 was  $14,012  million
compared  with  $6,983   million  in  1999.  The  result  for  2000  reflects  a
contribution  from ARCO for the period from April 14,  2000.  In  addition,  the
result is after charging  special items of $524 million,  and  depreciation  and
amortization  arising from the fixed asset  revaluation  adjustment and goodwill
consequent upon the ARCO  acquisition of $1,174  million.  Special items in 1999
amounted to $299 million.

      The  improved   result,   when  compared   with  a  year  ago,   reflected
significantly  higher oil and  natural  gas  prices,  the ARCO  acquisition  and
operational  improvements.  Our average  realized oil prices were $9.89 a barrel
higher and North American  natural gas prices (i.e. in our principal gas market)
were 76% above their 1999 level.

      Hydocarbon  production in 2000 was also at record levels, with the year up
4% on 1999.  Higher  underlying  (excluding the net impact of  acquisitions  and
divestments)  gas production and the ARCO acquisition more than offset lower oil
production  caused by the disposal of our common  interest in Altura  Energy and
other non-core properties and the effect of a reduced capital spending programme
in 1999.

      The  following  table  summarizes  the  changes in oil and gas  production
between 1999 and 2000. In order to present a meaningful comparison against 1999,
the table  adjusts  the  reported  production  in 1999 and 2000 to  exclude  the
production  from   significant   acquisitions   and   divestments.   A  separate
reconciliation for ARCO is also provided.

      In 2000,  finding and  development  costs  averaged  $3.29 a barrel of oil
equivalent,  against our ceiling of $3.50 per barrel.  Unit  lifting  costs were
reduced by 5% compared with 1999 to $2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent.

      In  2000,  reserve   replacement   exceeded  production  for  the  seventh
consecutive  year,  with 1.8 billion  barrels of oil equivalent  added to proved
reserves through revisions, extensions,  discoveries and improved recovery. This
represents a reserve replacement ratio of 163%.

      During  the year  there  were  several  developments  in support of future
hydrocarbon volume growth. In the North Sea we announced a $500-million enhanced
oil  recovery  project  at  Magnus.  In  the  deepwater  Gulf  of  Mexico,   the
developments  of King,  King's Peak,  Nakika and Horn Mountain were approved and
industrial  capacity  of around $3  billion  was  secured  for  fabrication  and
installation  of  additional  developments.  In  Vietnam,  key  elements  of the
$1.3-billion gas project were signed. In Alaska, a joint feasibility study for a
pipeline to transport gas to the rest of the USA and Canada was agreed.

      We recorded significant  exploration success in 2000. Progress in the Gulf
of Mexico  deepwater  continued  with the  discovery of Crazy Horse North which,
with the adjacent  Crazy Horse,  discovered  in 1999,  has  increased  estimated
recoverable  resources  in  this  complex.  In  Angola  we made  seven  offshore
discoveries,  including two in the BP - operated Block 18, bringing the total of
successes to 23 out of 26 wells  drilled since 1996. We made two large gas finds
offshore Trinidad, one of them the largest-ever in the Caribbean region.

      Advances  in  technology   sharpened  our  performance.   We  applied  new
fibre-optic  sensors in many wells to monitor  pumps,  pressures and flow rates,
thus  reducing  operating  costs and boosting  production  capacities.  We added
capability  to our seismic  imaging  tools,  allowing us to discern the shape of
hydrocarbon  reservoirs  more  clearly,  and worked with  suppliers to develop a
high-strength steel to reduce the cost of gas pipelines.

      Our  strategic   plans  to  upgrade  the  portfolio   continued  with  the
acquisition  of the  minority  interest  in Vastar  and the sale of BP's  common
interest in Altura  Energy.  We also agreed with partners to realign our oil and
gas interests in Prudhoe Bay, allowing us to optimize  operations and strengthen
our gas position significantly.

      Capital  expenditure and acquisitions rose substantially to $6,383 million
in 2000 from $4,194 million in 1999. This was largely  attributable to increases
in  development  drilling in the North  American  gas  business,  the  Northstar
project in Alaska,  Egypt gas  development  and  projects  in the Gulf of Mexico
deepwater.

      During 2001 many new projects  are  expected to come on stream,  including
six major oil and  natural  gas  fields in the Gulf of Mexico,  Alaska,  Angola,
Egypt and Norway.

      In  1999,  replacement  cost  operating  profit  was  $6,983  million,  an
improvement  of 120% over the  equivalent  result of 1998.  The  result is after
charging  special items of $299 million in 1999.  Special items in 1998 amounted
to $393  million.  Our oil  realizations  were  $4.68 a barrel  higher and North
American natural gas prices were 13% above their 1998 level. These environmental
benefits were significantly complemented by cost savings.

      Oil production  increased  slightly compared with 1998, with rising output
in the Eastern Trough Area Project  (ETAP) in the North Sea and at  Schiehallion
and Foinaven,  west of Shetland,  more than offsetting declines in Alaska and in
the more mature North Sea fields, and the effect of the sale of our Canadian oil
interests.  Natural gas production increased 4.5% to just over 6 bcf/d following
the start-up of a $1-billion liquefied natural gas plant in Trinidad.

      Technological  innovation  underpinned  our most  significant  exploration
achievement in 1999 - the discovery of the largest  deepwater field so far found
in the Gulf of Mexico,  the Crazy  Horse  field,  in which the Group holds a 75%
interest. Finding this field involved drilling through 1,800 metres (6,000 feet)
of water  and more than 600  metres  (2,000  feet) of salt to a record  depth of
7,830 metres (25,770 feet).

      Crazy Horse was only one of a number of major  finds in 1999.  In the Gulf
of Mexico we announced the discovery of three other fields - Holstein,  Atlantis
and Mad Dog.  In  Angola  our  exploration  success  continued  with  eight  new
discoveries.  Elsewhere  there  were  large  natural  gas finds in  Azerbaijan's
offshore  waters and in  Australia's  North West  Shelf.  In  December  1999,  a
consortium, in which BP has a 35% interest, announced that it had been awarded a
deep water concession offshore Brazil, the BFZ-2 block.

      The Gas and Power business,  which is reported  separately from January 1,
2000, is responsible for BP's world-wide gas marketing activities (although some
long term gas sales  contracts  are also  included  within the  Exploration  and
Production business) and all business development  opportunities in natural gas,
including   gas-fired   power   generation.   The  Gas  and  Power   stream  has
responsibility for the shareholding in Ruhrgas,  BP's existing gas marketing and
trading operations in the UK and North America, and world-wide power development
activities.  Gas and Power has established  business  development  operations in
Latin America, the Mediterranean,  the Caspian region, the Middle East, Northern
Europe, China and the Asia-Pacific region.

      The replacement  cost operating  profit for 2000 was $186 million compared
with $211 million in 1999. The result for 2000 includes a contribution from ARCO
for the period from April 14, 2000. The improved income from  operations  partly
offset increased business development costs.

      Increased  gas sales in North  America,  the UK and Spain  contributed  to
total sales of 14.5 billion cubic feet per day.

      The following  table  summarizes the changes in gas sales volumes  between
1999 and 2000. In order to present a meaningful  comparison  against  1999,  the
table adjusts the reported  amounts in 1999 and 2000 to exclude the contribution
from significant acquisitions.

      We became the first non-Spanish  company to win customers in Spain's newly
deregulated  gas  market.   Work  began  on  the  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)
regasification  terminal and gas-fired  power station at Bilbao,  Spain,  and we
agreed a  20-year  $2.5-billion  sale of LNG to power  plants  in the  Dominican
Republic.  In North  America  acquisitions  improved our wholesale and marketing
capabilities. We invested in GreenMountain.com, the leading US consumer marketer
of green  energy and  reached  agreement  with  PetroChina  to  establish  a gas
marketing  joint  venture  in  eastern  China.  We became  the first oil and gas
company  to order  new-build  LNG  vessels  not tied to a single  gas  source or
customer.

      Capital  expenditure and  acquisitions  was $279 million compared with $18
million in 1999.  Expenditure  in 2000  included  $125 million for the first two
instalments on two LNG ships and investment in GreenMountain.com.

      The replacement cost operating  profit for 1999 was $211 million  compared
with $58 million in 1998. The result for 1998 is after charging special items of
$92  million.  Apart  from the  impact  of  special  charges,  the  increase  of
$61 million in 1999 represents an increase in income from operations.

      Gas sales  increased  from 8.5  billion  cubic feet per day in 1998 to 8.9
billion cubic feet per day in 1999, driven mainly by growth in North America.

      During  1999,  we  acquired  all of the shares we did not own in  Canada's
second  largest  natural  gas  supply  aggregator,  ProGas.  ProGas  is based in
Calgary,  Alberta,  and  purchases gas from  approximately  170 producers in the
western  Canadian  Sedimentary  Basin. It markets 1.45 bcf/d of gas across North
America.

European  fuels  business from August 1, 2000. In addition,  the result is after
charging special items of $595 million and depreciation and amortization arising
from the fixed asset  revaluation  adjustment and goodwill  consequent  upon the
ARCO and Burmah  Castrol  acquisitions  of $440  million.  Special items in 1999
amounted to $242 million.  The 2000 result  benefited from cost reductions and a
strong oil trading performance.

      In 2000,  refining  margins were stronger in all regions than in 1999, and
NGL margins were generally strong.  Marketing margins came under pressure due to
the inability to pass through high product prices in competitive markets.

      The  acquisition of ARCO gave us  coast-to-coast  market access in the USA
and the  acquisition  of Burmah Castrol  significantly  increased our lubricants
activities  throughout the world. Since unveiling our new global brand, sites in
the USA and Europe  are  preparing  for  conversion  during  2001.  In  emerging
markets,  fuel  sales  rose by 22% and we  opened 75 new  retail  sites in Latin
America, Poland, Russia and Africa. Growth in aviation fuel sales was strong. In
August 2000,  we  completed  the  purchase of  ExxonMobil's  30% interest in the
BP/Mobil European fuels business for $1.5 billion.

      The  following  table  summarizes  changes  in  refinery  throughputs  and
marketing  sales volumes between 1999 and 2000. In order to present a meaningful
comparison against 1999, the table adjusts the reported amounts in 1999 and 2000
to exclude the contribution from significant acquisitions and divestments.

       During 2000 we  commercialized  a novel  process to remove  sulphur  from
gasoline  and diesel at low cost and with no loss of octane.  This is helping to
advance  the rate at which we  introduce  new clean  fuels.  By the end of 2000,
cleaner fuels had gone on sale in 56 cities worldwide, against a target of 40.

      Capital  expenditure and  acquisitions in 2000 was $8,750 million compared
with $1,634 million in 1999. The Group's capital expenditure on refinery assets,
including  environmental  expenditures  and  investments in line with regulatory
requirements  to  improve  product  quality,  totalled  $1,642  million  in 2000
compared with $607 million in 1999.  During 2000 our Bulwer  Island  refinery in
Queensland,  Australia,  commissioned  a new  hydrocracker  complex three months
ahead of  schedule.  We  completed  a project at Sines,  Portugal,  to develop a
liquefied  petroleum gas storage  cavern,  and  progressed a similar  project at
Ningbo on the  Chinese  coast.  These are  examples  of a number of  initiatives
undertaken  as part of our drive  for  cleaner  fuels.  Capital  expenditure  on
marketing assets amounted to $7,108 million in 2000 compared with $1,027 million
in the previous year. The substantial  increase in 2000 reflects the acquisition
of Burmah Castrol and ExxonMobil's share of the BP/Mobil European joint venture.

      In 2000, as part of the Company's  global  refining  strategy we completed
the sale to Tosco Corporation of the Alliance refinery in Louisana and announced
the intended  disposal of three US refineries and their  associated  facilities.
The  three  refineries  -- Salt Lake City in Utah,  Mandan in North  Dakota  and
Yorktown in Virginia  -- have a combined  capacity of 177,000  barrels a day. In
addition to the US  refineries  we have  announced the intention to sell our 30%
interest in our Singapore  refinery of which BP's share is 78,000 barrels a day.
The refineries will continue to operate normally during the sales process. It is
anticipated that the sales process will be completed by mid-2001.

      During 2001, we plan to open more than 300 BP Connect  convenience  retail
sites  worldwide  sporting  the new helios  brand mark as part of a  longer-term
reimaging plan. The cost of rebranding  existing sites in 2001 is expected to be
around  $190  million.  In total,  we plan to have the new helios  brand mark in
place on more than 5,000 sites by the end of 2001.

      In 1999,  Refining and Marketing  achieved a highly  competitive return on
fixed assets despite plummeting margins in refining,  which fell by 48% compared
with the previous  year.  Replacement  cost  operating  profit of $1,840 million
represented a decrease of 28% compared with 1998.  The result is after  charging
special  items of $242 million in 1999.  There were no special  charges in 1998.
Apart from the impact of special  charges the decrease  reflects the rise in the
price of crude oil and refined  products and  consequent  tightening of margins.
The  deterioration  in the refining  environment  led to run cuts at a number of
refineries.  The pressure on marketing  margins  reflected rising product prices
which could not be fully  recovered in the market.  Significant  cost reductions
moderated the effect of the harsher trading environment.

       In 1999  retail  volumes  rose while shop  revenues  grew faster than the
market at 6%, reflecting the strength of our convenience  retail business in the
USA and UK.  More than 170 new retail  sites were  opened  worldwide  during the
year,  with 90 opened in Poland,  China,  Venezuela  and  Russia.  Growth in our
aviation business was strong,  and Air BP was recognized as the World's Best Jet
Fuel Marketer by an authoritative industry survey.

- ----------

(a)   The   Chemicals   Indicator   Margin  (CIM)  is  a  weighted   average  of
      externally-based  product margins. It is based on market data collected by
      Chem Systems in their quarterly  market  analyses,  then weighted based on
      BP's product portfolio.  While it does not cover our entire portfolio,  it
      includes a broader  range of products than our previous  indicator.  Among
      the  products  and  businesses  covered  in the CIM are  the  olefins  and
      derivatives, the aromatics and derivatives,  linear alpha olefins,  acetic
      acid,  vinyl acetate  monomer and  nitriles.  Not included are Fabrics and
      Fibres, plastic fabrications, poly alpha olefins,  anhydrides, Engineering
      Polymers and Carbon Fibres,  speciality  intermediates,  and the remaining
      parts of the solvents and acetyls businesses.

(b)   Provisional.  The data for the current  year is based on eleven  months of

      Chemicals'  replacement  cost operating  profit was $760 million  compared
with $686 million in 1999. The results for 2000 and 1999 include special charges
of $276 million and $247 million respectively. Productivity improvements in 2000
more than offset the effects of the weaker environment.

       Chemicals'  demand was firm in the first half of 2000,  but then weakened
in the final two quarters as the global economy slowed.  Annual  production rose
1% to 22.1 million  tonnes,  despite  operational  difficulties  at Grangemouth,
Scotland.  Several  initiatives  to promote cost and capital  efficiency  helped
offset pressure on margins that were close to cyclical lows, as high oil and gas
prices  boosted  feedstock  costs.  The  weakness of the euro added  pressure on
margins in our European operations.

      Capital  expenditure and  acquisitions in 2000 was $1,585 million compared
with $1,215 million in 1998. A major  programme of UK investment  continued with
the  successful   commissioning  of  polypropylene  and  polyethylene  units  at
Grangemouth.

      In  2000  our  chemicals   activities  focused  on  areas  of  competitive
advantage. We reached agreement in principle to acquire Bayer's 50% shareholding
in the  Erdolchemie  joint venture in Germany;  this  represents  the 50% of the
joint  venture we do not already  own.  Our  polypropylene  joint  venture  with
ATOFINA was dissolved, giving us full control of assets at Grangemouth and a 50%
share of production in Lavera, France. We commissioned a world-scale acetic acid
plant in Malaysia  and made  progress on planning a  $2.5-billion  ethylene  and
derivatives joint venture near Shanghai in China. In November construction began
of a $360-million  PTA plant at Zhuhai in southern China,  and another PTA plant
was  announced in Taiwan.  We  announced  several  related  deals with Solvay of
Belgium, involving assets with a combined turnover of $2.6 billion.

       During  2001,  petrochemicals  capacity  is  planned to be  increased  at
Grangemouth   and  Hull  in  the  UK,  and  in  Canada,   production  of  linear
alpha-olefins is scheduled to begin at a new world-scale facility.

      In 1999,  replacement cost operating profit was $686 million compared with
$1,110  million in 1998.  The  result is after  charging  special  items of $247
million in 1999. Special charges in 1998 were $50 million.  Chemicals margins in
several  commodity  product  areas fell to levels  below the low points  seen in
previous  cycles.  At the same time the effects of the financial  crisis in Asia
continued  to be felt,  especially  in Europe,  where  weakness of the euro also
contributed to pressure on margins. This adverse external environment was offset
partially by a clear focus on cost  reductions  and  releasing  the value of the
merger of BP and Amoco.  Total volume of product  manufactured  rose by 6% to an
all-time  record of 21.9  million  tonnes  as new  capacity  came on stream  and
production  reliability  increased.  These  increases in production  were partly
offset by disposals.

      In 1999 we  disposed  of the Verdugt  acid salts  business in Europe,  the
Plaskon electronic materials business based in the USA and Singapore,  our share
of the olefins  cracker in Wilton,  UK, the US Fibers and Yarns business and the
Plaspack  Kunststoffe plastic net and webbing business and we completed the sale
and  leaseback of railcars in the USA. In addition,  we announced the closure of
our  joint-venture  Singapore  Aromatics  complex.  In 2000, BP refinanced  this
entity's  bank  loans  and sold  its  interest  in this  entity  to  ExxonMobil,
resulting in a loss of $209 million ($148 million after tax).

       In 1999, a number of new chemicals  projects aimed at  strengthening  our
portfolio  were  sanctioned or announced,  including a new 250,000 tonnes a year
linear alpha-olefins plant in Alberta,  Canada, and the expansion of trimellitic
anhydride capacity at our plant in Joliet, Illinois.

       In China our 150,000-tonnes-a-year acetic acid joint venture with Sinopec
at Yaraco was commissioned early in the year. Another joint venture with Sinopec
- - the detailed  planning phase of a world-scale  900,000-tonnes-a-year  ethylene
cracker and derivative  product units near Shanghai - received official approval
in the Autumn. Start-up is expected in 2005.

      Other Businesses and Corporate  comprises Finance,  BP Solar, our coal and
aluminium assets, our investments in PetroChina and Sinopec, interest income and
costs relating to corporate activities worldwide.

       The net cost of Other Businesses and Corporate in 2000 amounted to $1,110
million.  This includes a  contribution  from ARCO for the period from April 14,
2000 and special charges of $488 million.

      BP Solar production and shipments for 2000 were 31% higher than in 1999. A
total of 42 megawatts (MW) of solar panel  generating  capacity was sold in 2000
(1999, 32 MW and 1998, 27 MW).


                                       74

      During 2000, we purchased a 2.2%  interest in PetroChina  for $578 million
and a 2.2% interest in Sinopec for $416 million - two of Asia's  largest oil and
natural gas companies.

       The net cost of Other  Businesses  and Corporate of $826 million for 1999
included  $398  million for  rationalization  costs  following  the BP and Amoco
merger.

Interest Expense

      Interest  expense in 2000 was $1,770 million  compared with $1,316 million
in 1999.  These amounts included special charges of $111 million and $24 million
respectively,  arising from the early  redemption of bonds.  After adjusting for
these special charges,  the increase in Group interest expense in 2000 reflected
higher debt and interest rates.

       Interest  expense in 1999 was $1,316 million compared with $1,177 million
in 1998. The increase  reflected lower  capitalized  interest and higher average
debt, the effects of which were partly offset by lower interest rates.

Taxation

      The charge for corporate  taxes in 2000 was $4,972  million  compared with
$1,880  million in 1999,  and $1,520  million in 1998. The effective tax rate on
historical  cost profit was 29% in 2000, 27% in 1999 and 32% in 1998. The higher
rate in 2000 compared to 1999 reflects the non-deductibility for tax purposes of
ARCO  and  Burmah  Castrol  acquisition  amortization;  the  reduced  impact  of
beneficial  timing  differences  due to the higher level of income;  and reduced
untaxed  inventory  holding  gains,  partly  mitigated  by  the  utilization  of
significant brought-forward tax credit balances. The lower rate in 1999 compared
with 1998 was due to the impact of unrelieved  inventory holding losses in 1998,
partly offset by the low tax relief on net exceptional losses in 1999.

      The effective tax rate on replacement cost profit before exceptional items
was 29% (27% after  adjusting for special items and  acquisition  amortization),
compared with 28% in 1999 and 25% in 1998. The higher rate in 2000 was caused by
the non-deductability  for tax purposes of the acquisition  amortization and the
reduced  impact of  beneficial  timing  differences  due to the higher  level of
income.  The increase in effective  rate in 1999 over 1998 reflected the effects
of tax on inventory holding gains in 1999 and inventory holding losses in 1998.

Outlook

      The overall trading  environment is expected to remain generally positive,
notwithstanding  less favourable  economic  conditions than those experienced in
2000. Oil and gas prices are likely to remain volatile, in a trading range below
the peaks seen during 2000.  Refining margins should continue to be supported by
tightness  in  product  stocks,  though  in the  first  quarter  the  effect  of
strengthened  margins  in the USA were more than  offset  by weaker  margins  in
Europe and Asia.  Marketing margins are likely to reflect competitive  pressures
after recent falls in the oil price. The chemicals trading environment is likely
to come  under  further  pressure  from a  moderation  in  economic  growth  and
increasing supply capacity.

      Operating and capital expenditure on the prevention, control, abatement or

discrete  identifiable   transaction.   Instead,  it  forms  part  of  a  larger
transaction which includes,  for example,  normal maintenance  expenditure.  The
figures for  environmental  operating and capital  expenditure  in the table are
therefore  estimates,  based on the  definitions  and guidelines of the American
Petroleum Institute.

       Environmental  operating  and  capital  expenditures  were higher in 2000
principally due to the inclusion of ARCO and Burmah  Castrol.  Similar levels of
operating and capital  expenditure  are expected in the foreseeable  future.  In
addition to operating and capital  expenditures,  we also create  provisions for
future  environmental  remediation.   Expenditure  against  such  provisions  is
normally  incurred in  subsequent  periods and is not included in  environmental
operating  expenditure reported for such periods.  Included within special items
is a charge of $170 million relating to environmental  liabilities at certain US
sites. The charge appears within operating  expenditure ($50 million) and in new
provisions for environmental remediation ($120 million).

       Provisions  for  environmental  remediation  are made when a clean-up  is
probable  and  the  amount  reasonably  determinable.  Generally,  their  timing
coincides  with  commitment  to a formal  plan of  action  or,  if  earlier,  on
divestment or on closure of inactive sites.

       The  extent  and cost of future  remediation  programmes  are  inherently
difficult to estimate.  They depend on the scale of any possible  contamination,
the timing and extent of corrective  actions,  and also the Group's share of the
liability. Although the cost of any future remediation could be significant, and
may be  material  to the  result  of  operations  in the  period  in which it is
recognized,  we do not expect that such costs will have a material effect on the
Group's  financial  position  or  liquidity.   We  believe  our  provisions  are
sufficient  for known  requirements;  and we do not believe  that our costs will
differ significantly from those of other companies (with similar assets) engaged
in  similar  industries  or that  our  competitive  position  will be  adversely
affected as a result.

       In  addition,  we make  provisions  over the useful lives of our oil- and
gas-producing  assets  and  related  pipelines  to meet  the  cost  of  eventual
decommissioning.  Provisions for environmental  remediation and  decommissioning
are usually set up on a discounted  basis,  as required by  Financial  Reporting
Standard No.12,  `Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and Contingent  Assets'.
Further details of decommissioning  and environmental  provisions appear in Item
18 -- Note 27 of Notes to Financial  Statements.  See also Item 4 -- Information
on the Company -- Environmental Protection.

Insurance

       The Group  generally  restricts  its purchase of insurance to  situations
where  this is  required  for  legal or  contractual  reasons.  This is  because
external  insurance is not considered an economic means of financing  losses for
the Group. Losses will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread
over time  through  insurance  premia  with  attendant  transaction  costs.  The
position will be reviewed periodically.

The Euro

       As a result of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended
by the Treaty on European Union,  (the Treaty),  European  economic and monetary
union (EMU) has occurred for eleven out of the fifteen  member  countries of the
European Union (participating countries). The final stage of the Treaty began on
January 1, 1999.

       For the participating countries, the fixed conversion rates between their
sovereign  currencies (legacy  currencies) prior to January 1, 1999 and the euro
have been established. The euro has been adopted as their common legal currency.
The legacy  currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as  denominations of
the euro between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002 (the transition period).

       The United Kingdom has not  participated  initially in EMU, but may do so
at a later time. The current policy of the UK government is that any decision to
join EMU will only be taken  after a national  referendum  of the people and, in
any event, not before 2002.

      BP's commercial and financial processes were successfully adapted to allow
its  European  operations  to  undertake  transactions  in the euro and  capture
competitive  advantage  offered by the new  currency,  from January 1, 1999.  In
common with experience generally across Europe, the actual level of transactions
in euros for our  businesses  continues to be low.  The  currency of  accounting
records and the related systems are now being converted to euros. The capability
to conduct  business in the former national  currencies will be retained as long
as necessary. The costs associated with the euro programme are estimated at $100
million,  of which some $60 million had been incurred and expensed by the end of
2000.

       It is  difficult  to predict  whether  the euro will  affect the level or
volatility  of  foreign  exchange  rates.  However,  we do not  expect  that the
introduction  of the euro will have a significant  effect on the Group's results
of operations, its financial position or liquidity.

Net cash inflow from operating activities...................  20,416    10,290      9,586
Net cash inflow (outflow) ..................................   3,743       (82)      (906)
</TABLE>

      Net cash inflow for the year was $3,743 million,  compared with an outflow
of $82 million in 1999.  This results from an almost  doubling of operating cash
flow partially  offset by higher tax payments and net cash outflows from capital
expenditure,  acquisitions  and disposals.

      Net cash inflow from operating  activities increased to $20,416 million in
2000 from $10,290  million in 1999. The main factor in this  improvement was the
increased operating earnings.

      Dividends from joint ventures and associated  undertakings  decreased from
$1,168 million in 1999 to $1,039  million in 2000. The principal  factor in this
decrease was the  dissolution  in August,  2000 of the BP/Mobil  European  joint
venture  partially  offset by an increase  in  dividends  from other  associated
undertakings.  The net cash outflow  from  servicing of finance and returns from
investments  decreased to $892 million from $1,003 million in 1999,  principally
because of the lower payment of dividends to minority shareholders. The increase
in interest  payments was largely  offset by the increase in interest  receipts.
Tax  payments  rose to  $6,198  million  in 2000  from  $1,260  million  in 1999
reflecting  increased  taxation as a result of higher profits and  approximately
$1.6 billion relating to the FTC mandated disposal of ARCO's Alaskan  businesses
and certain pipeline  interests in the Lower 48 States,  which are accounted for
under the allocation of purchase price as opposed to the current tax charge.

      Payments for capital  expenditures  on fixed  assets net of proceeds  from
sales of fixed assets, amounted to $7,072 million, an increase of $1,687 million
on 1999. Higher capital expenditure in 2000 was partly offset by higher disposal
proceeds.  We are targeting  annual  investment in the $12-13 billion range over
the period  2001-2003 which is consistent with historic levels of investment for
the enlarged group.

      Acquisitions  and  disposals of  businesses  produced a net cash inflow of
$865  million  compared  with $243  million in 1999.  The  increase  in disposal
proceeds of $7,041  million,  which included $6,803 million for the FTC mandated
sales,  was largely offset by increased spend on acquisitions and investments in
associated undertakings.

      Overall net cash outflow for capital expenditure and acquisitions,  net of
disposals, was $6,207 million (1999 $5,142 million).

      Dividend payments  increased to $4,415 million from $4,135 million in 1999
reflecting  the increase in shares in issue as a result of the ARCO  acquisition
and the  dividend  increase in the third  quarter of 2000,  partially  offset by
share repurchases during the year.

      Net cash  outflow for 1999 was $82 million  compared  with $906 million in
1998.  The change  reflected  improved  operating  results and lower net capital
expenditure,  partly offset by  restructuring  and integration  costs and higher
dividend payments.

      Net cash inflow from operating  activities increased to $10,290 million in
1999 from $9,568  million in 1998.  The main  factors in this  improvement  were
increased  operating  earnings  offset to a large  extent by an  increase in the
funding requirement for working capital caused by the increase in oil prices.

      Dividends from joint ventures and associated  undertakings  increased from
$966 million in 1998 to $1,168  million in 1999.  The  principal  factor in this
increase was improved  results from the BP/Mobil joint venture  partially offset
by a decrease in  dividends  from other  associated  undertakings.  The net cash
outflow  from  servicing of finance and returns  from  investments  increased to
$1,003  million  from $825  million in 1998,  principally  as a result of higher
interest  payments  being made on the higher average level of debt. Tax payments
fell from $1,705 million in 1998 to $1,260  million in 1999  reflecting a degree
of lag in the timing of tax payments.

      Payments for capital  expenditures  on fixed  assets net of proceeds  from
sales of fixed assets in 1999, amounted to $5,385 million, a reduction of $1,913
million on 1998. This reduction was a result of the Group's decision to increase
the focus of its capital programme.

<PAGE>
      Acquisitions  and  disposals of  businesses  produced a net cash inflow of
$243  million  compared  with $778  million in 1999.  The major  element of this
reduction  in cash inflow was the  turnaround  of the funding of joint  ventures
from a net release of funds in 1998 of $708 million to a net requirement of $750
million in 1999.  This  increase  in cash  outflow  was  partially  offset by an
increase  in  proceeds  from the sale of  businesses  which  amounted  to $1,292
million  in 1999  compared  with $780  million  in 1998.  Also  within  this net
reduction  were cash outflows for  acquisitions  and  investments  in associated
undertakings  which  amounted to $299  million,  a decrease of $411 million over
1998.

      Dividend  payments  increased by $1,727 million to $4,135 million in 1999.
This  reflected  the  termination  of the former BP share  dividend plan and the
fifth dividend payment in 1999 due to the  harmonization and acceleration of the
payment timetable.

Financing the Group's Activities

      The  Group's  principal  commodity,  oil,  is  priced  internationally  in
dollars.  Group  policy  has been to  minimize  economic  exposure  to  currency
movements  by  financing  operations  with US  dollar  debt  wherever  possible,
otherwise  by using  currency  swaps when funds have been  raised in  currencies
other than dollars.

      The Group's finance debt is almost entirely in US dollars.  Net debt, that
is debt less cash and liquid resources,  was $19,359 million at the end of 2000,
an increase of $6,336  million over the year.  Gross debt consisted of long term
borrowings of $14,772 million and short term  borrowings of $6,418 million.  Net
debt of $6,579 million was acquired with ARCO and Burmah Castrol.  Following the
acquisitions, the Group repurchased $960 million of outstanding debt in order to
provide greater financing  flexibility for the future.  The ratio of net debt to
net debt plus equity was 21%,  compared with 23% a year ago. After adjusting for
the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and
Burmah Castrol  acquisitions,  the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity was
27%. We expect to keep this adjusted ratio in the range of 20-30%.  The maturity
profile and fixed/floating rate  characteristics of the Group debt are described
in Item 18 -- Financial Statements -- Note 25.

      At December  31, 2000  contracts  had been  placed for  authorized  future
capital  expenditure   estimated  at  $4,141  million,   mainly  in  respect  of
exploration  and  production  activities.  Such  expenditure  is  expected to be
financed largely by cash flow from operating  activities.  At December 31, 2000,
the Group had available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of $3,450 million
($3,000 million at December 31, 1999).

      BP has in place a Debt  Issuance  Programme  (the  Programme).  Under  the
Programme  certain  subsidiaries  of the Group may from time to time  issue debt
securities  guaranteed by the Company.  The debt may have a minimum  maturity of
one  month  and no  maximum  maturity.  Aggregate  debt  outstanding  under  the
Programme  will not at any time  exceed $6  billion or the  equivalent  in other
currencies.  At March 30, 2001, the amount drawn down against this Programme was
$2,237 million.

      BP believes that, taking into account  unutilized market  facilities,  the
Group has sufficient working capital for foreseeable requirements.

Liquidity Risk

      Liquidity  risk is the risk  that  suitable  sources  of  funding  for the
Group's business  activities may not be available.  The Group has long-term debt
ratings of Aa1 and AA+ assigned respectively by Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
The Group has access to a wide range of funding at competitive rates through the
capital markets and banks. It co-ordinates  relationships with banks,  borrowing
requirements,  foreign exchange requirements and cash management centrally.  The
Group  believes  it has  access  to  sufficient  funding  and has  also  undrawn
committed  borrowing   facilities  to  meet  currently   foreseeable   borrowing
requirements.  At December 31, 2000, the Group had available  undrawn  committed
facilities of $3,450 million. These committed facilities,  which are mainly with
a number of international  banks, expire in 2001. The Group expects to renew the
facilities on an annual basis.

Credit Risk

      Credit risk is the potential exposure of the Group to loss in the event of
non-performance  by a  counterparty.  The credit risk  arising  from the Group's
normal commercial  operations is controlled by individual operating units within
guidelines.  In  addition,  as a result of its use of  financial  and  commodity
instruments,  including derivatives, to manage market risk, the Group has credit
exposures  through its dealings in the  financial  and  specialized  oil and gas
markets.  The Group  controls the related credit risk by entering into contracts
only with  highly  credit-rated  counterparties  and through  credit  approvals,
limits and monitoring  procedures,  and does not usually  require  collateral or
other security.  Counterparty credit validation,  independent of the dealers, is
undertaken before contractual commitment. The Group has not experienced material
non-performance by any counterparty.
